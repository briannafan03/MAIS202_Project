38094,38,2/17/2003,4,Great with a salad. Cooked on top of stove for 15 minutes.Added a shake of cayenne and a pinch of salt.  Used low fat sour cream.  Thanks.
1293707,38,12/21/2011,5,"So simple, so delicious! Great for chilly fall evening. Should have doubled it ;)<br/><br/>Second time around, forgot the remaining cumin. We usually love cumin, but didn't notice the missing 1/2 teaspoon!"
8937,38,12/1/2002,4,This worked very well and is EASY.  I used not quite a whole package (10oz) of white chips.  Great!
126440,38,2/27/2010,5,I made the Mexican topping and took it to bunko.  Everyone loved it.
57222,39,10/1/2011,5,"Made the cheddar bacon topping, adding a sprinkling of black pepper. Yum!"
52282,40,5/21/2005,4,very very sweet. after i waited the 2 days i bought 2 more pints of raspberries and added them to the mix. i'm going to add some as a cake filling today and will take a photo.
124416,40,8/6/2011,0,"Just an observation, so I will not rate.  I followed this procedure with strawberries instead of raspberries.  Perhaps this is the reason it did not work well.  Sorry to report that the strawberries I did in August were moldy in October.  They were stored in my downstairs fridge, which is very cold and infrequently opened.  Delicious and fresh-tasting prior to that, though.  So, keep a sharp eye on them.  Personally I would not keep them longer than a month.  This recipe also appears as #120345 posted in July 2009, which is when I tried it.  I also own the Edna Lewis cookbook in which this appears."
2000192946,40,5/10/2015,2,"This recipe was OVERLY too sweet.  I would start out with 1/3 or 1/4 cup of sugar and jsut add on from there.  Just 2 cups was way too much and I had to go back to the grocery store to buy more raspberries because it made so much mix.  Overall, I would but the long narrow box or raspberries.  Its a perfect fit for the recipe plus a little extra.  I was not impressed with this recipe.  It was exceptionally over-sweet.  If you make this simple recipe, MAKE SURE TO ADD LESS SUGAR!"
76535,40,9/2/2005,4,Very good!
273745,40,12/22/2005,5,Better than the real!!
353911,40,9/26/2006,5,"Absolutely AWESOME! I was speechless when I tried them. I've never had such juicy melt-in-your-mouth chicken made AT HOME!

I would, however, suggest to reduce the amount of flour. 2 cups was overkill for me. "
190375,40,3/9/2007,5,These taste absolutely wonderful!!  My son-in-law loves them and requests them often! I followed the recipe exactly.  Thanks so much for posting this recipe.
468945,40,2/20/2008,0,"Made my own buttermilk w/ vinegar and milk.  Used defrosted fresh skinless/boneless chicken fillets.  3 lbs.
This mix is extremely flavorful and its light .  I didnt do the bbq thing, but while I cooked homemade to go w/ this I put the chicken in the oven to keep warm and served bbq dipping sauce.  10 stars from my kids !"
255338,40,4/11/2008,5,"First time using liquid smoke in a recipe. Made this as directed. My kids enjoyed this, so we will make this again. Thank you for posting."
1171894,41,4/21/2009,5,"MMMMM! This is so good! I actually soaked the chicken in chicken bouillon first, and it made it super flavorful. I use Sweet Baby Ray's bbq sauce (DH's favorite), and cut chicken into nuggets instead of strips. This makes a good amount, so you could really freeze some and reheat in oven later. Those were our plans, but it was so good that it didn't make it to the ziploc bag!"
136726,41,11/25/2006,5,"I used this mix to make meat balls.Very simple to put together.  I made a batch to put in the freezer too. I find meatballs are really handy to have around just add sauce and cheese for pasta meal or appetizer or for subs or snack.  These turned out to be very good I did add some garlic, but other than that I followed the recipe. The cinnamon in this added something to this that sets it apart from most meatball recipes I tried. Thanks for posting."
68960,43,12/19/2006,4,"We really enjoyed this and so did both my young daughters. For this recipe I decided my crockpot would be perfect. I basically followed the recipe exactally except instead of adding the flour to the onions, I made a mix of flour, salt and pepper in a bag and then tossed the lamb to coat before browning. I added the spices to the onion/garlic to toast them slightly before deglazing with stock. Because I used the crockpot I cut the stock back to about 1/2 - 3/4 cup and used all the canned tomatoes. I added the canned chickpeas about an hour before serving.  This ended up cooking in the crockpot on low for about 6-7 hours. Served with Recipe #96875 this is a fabulous, filling family meal. Thank you for posting."
618928,45,10/17/2007,4,this is an excellent got 'lamb and a tin of chickpeas what should I cook' recipe. I used our slow cooker too. I made it for 4-5 people ( so 680grms lamb).I followed the recipe but used a can of tomatoes and alittle stock ( maybe 1/4 cup) and transfered the simmered tomatoes to the lamb waiting in the slow cooker. On low for about 5-6 hrs perfect!
217118,45,4/18/2008,5,"This was a lovely Morrocan style dish. I halved the recipe and made it on the stove top like a stew. I added a bit more stock to keep it from drying out. I left off the parsley and/or cilantro, didn't have any. Served with some warm pita type flat breads. I have a VERY picky Husband that even enjoyed this dish."
2000049093,45,3/8/2015,5,"I love lamb stew and usually make an Irish version with potatoes, celery, carrots, onions or something close.  Now and then I&#039;m looking for a change of pace.  Using this recipe as a basis this turned out a really tasty and healthy lamb stew.   I plan to alternate this with the Irish style.  Mmm.  

I used the canned tomatoes, chickpeas, onion, garlic, also a little celery, a jalapeno pepper, and diced-up carrot and malanga root.  Used cumin, cinnamon, ginger, rosemary,  and cloves as well as salt and pepper.  Nice peppy flavor.

Looks great as well, if I get the camera working hope to send a picture."
202555,48,6/20/2007,5,"My husband has just found out that he had to cut down on fat. He..like a lot of Okies is a solid meat and potato guy. 
It has been really hard to find things that he likes to eat but this recipe fit the bill. Has a wonderful flavor and we didn't miss the beef at all with this.
I would highly recommend!!!"
353579,48,8/14/2007,5,"Very good, made with ingredients I usually have.  I didn't want to heat up my kitchen, so I did the final cooking in the microwave, which worked just fine.  Thanks for posting!"
635209,49,11/6/2007,4,"Thought this was a great Core recipe.  My 79-year-old mom loved it too.  I did multiply the proportions x 3 or 4 so I could use whole cans of beans/Ro-tel tomatoes.  Also just added whole egg to the topping due to time and it was very good, but probably not as light as with egg white. I also was out of chicken broth and just used water and upped the seasonings; and used part shredded chicken and part canned chicken breast.  I made it spicy and served it with fat-free sour cream on top.  A winner!!"
681408,49,3/14/2008,0,This is a very good recipe.  We also want to cut back on the fat content in our diet . Very tasty dish!!!
684460,49,1/18/2009,5,We really liked this recipe - something different with chicken is always good to find.  The topping is really good - the kids thought it looked like a twinkie.  They really liked it; even if it wasn't a giant twinkie.
900992,49,2/19/2009,3,"The ""cornbread"" on top is bland. I'd us a real cornbread recipe and put it on top instead."
135017,49,9/29/2007,5,"I am extremely picky about my crockpot recipes (don't like most). This one was great! I made a half-recipe with 1 lb. of pork chops. Because my crockpot tends to burn meat (it's old, with the element on the bottom), I put the fruit mixture in first, then put the chops on top. I then spooned some of the fruit mixture on top of the meat. While at work I remembered I forgot to halve the wine (hee hee) but they still turned out just fine. Thanks, lazyme!
P.S.  I forgot to note that I did not do the cornstarch part and it was fine -- it made a juicy gravy that was nice with the mashed potatoes I also made.  Also, I did not have fresh cranberries and used a scant 1/2 cup of craisins instead, and that was fine, too.  It's all good, lazyme!"
224088,49,10/21/2007,4,"Pork + fruit + crockpot = awesome.

A very good recipe!  Like the other reviewer, we used only about a pound of pork chops, had to sub dried cranberries and didn't bother with the cornstarch.  I didn't really chop things up, just quartered and cored the apples and threw the dried apricots in wholeâ€”everything cooked down to bits. I also skipped the wine.  The apricots and cranberries provided a very intense, rich taste that went great with the pork.  Thanks for the recipe!"
582223,49,12/9/2007,5,really good my 18 month old loved it and she's really picky. I wasn't sure what type of wine to use so I used red. Thanks for the recipe!
1413963,49,10/15/2009,5,One word says it all . Delicious!!!
483827,49,7/15/2008,5,Being a  huge fan of America's Test Kitchen  I just had  to try this and I am  sure glad I did. It is really good. Sweet  corn is  just  coming in season here  and I have  chives in my herb garden so I had all the  best ingredients. I did  use a Jalapeno from the  garden instead of the  habanero. I  just made this and I plan to have it with some chicken. I'll  bet you could use some nice peaches to change it up a bit.      Thanks for posting .
56680,49,11/11/2006,5,"Oh, This was wonderful!  Had a soup and salad dinner and most people barely ate salad, LOL.  This doubled easily and reheats well too!"
5060,49,5/7/2010,5,"wow red and white sweetness!  DH loved them , I found them a bit two sweet for me but a nice change to serve strawberries.  very easy recipe, but I think 8 ounces of strawvberries is not enough, if I make them again I will double the strawberries and use about half of the cool whip. (I use light cool whip.)  Thanks for posting."
935485,49,6/22/2009,5,Being a healthy bar this is very good.  I make just a couple of changes.  I used stevia instead of splenda.  I used recipe #81194 for the egg substitue.  And I used pure vanilla extract instead of the coffee mate.  I will be making a lot of these!
539686,49,3/28/2011,5,My very health conscious daughter and I tripled this recipe and love them as cookie-sized treats. Very filling and healthy too. Thanks for posting.
6258,49,7/9/2002,5,"Jan, what an interesting combination of flavors.
Really unique and very tasty.  I am so proud of myself because I am growing an herb garden and I had the chives and oregano (fresh).  You didn't specify whether the sundried tomatoes were oil packed or dry, so I chose the dry ones since you had olive oil listed.  I didn't have the pine nuts, so I used sunflower seeds, and that worked out well.  I loved eating this salad...no real cooking on a hot evening.  I will make this one again.  I am wondering how fresh tarragon would be instead of the oregano?  Maybe I will be brave and make it that way soon.  If I do, I will let you know how the substitution fit in.  Thanks for posting this one!"
102602,49,10/26/2003,5,"Jan, we love your pasta salad, it's delicious. I've never used chives in a pasta salad before, it adds a very nice flavor. I made a few changes, I omitted the bacon and served the pine nuts on the side (DS HATES pine nuts). I added some extra garlic, a grating of parmesan cheese and some fresh basil (couldn't resist, it's grows right next to the oregano and chives in my garden). I'll be making this again... soon. Thanks for posting this recipe! "
172467,49,8/24/2009,5,"Lucious cake, firm on the outside, warm and creamy inside. Looks like you slaved away all day but the directions are easy. I will definitely make this again. it's a keeper! Thanks for posting."
2042100,49,10/23/2011,5,"Amazing recipe! The cakes taste even better than the ones you get in most restaurants. Everyone loves it! Easy and on the spot.<br/><br/>Usually I divide it by 3, since there's only my fiancee and me in my house and the regular amount can last for a week."
2002068522,49,3/26/2018,0,i made it and it was amazing
58332,49,2/25/2003,4,"The flavor of the vinegar was a little too ""whang!"" for me so I added a little olive oil.  This tempered the acidity and made a really good lunch. Thank you!"
160497,49,4/22/2007,5,"I have made this several times now.  I substitute regular white vinegar for the white wine vinegar and the whole family enjoys this!  The dressing does not overwhelm the flavors of the vegetables. I also have doubled the recipe, using one can black beans and one can red beans with two cans white beans for a different color combination."
67026,50,5/8/2004,4,Good basic recipe that i used as the basis of some great red sauce.  Thanks!
183565,50,2/13/2006,5,"Wow!  My family loves this recipe and it is a great winter meal.  I do have to say that I adjusted a little but the base remains the same.  Here's what I did different:  I peeled my potatoes and diced them very small. I left out the creamed corn, nutmeg, cayenne pepper, and parsley.  Instead I used approx. 1 tsp of Old Bay seasoning. Then right before I stirred in the crab meat, I used my potato masher to mash up some of the potatoes.  This makes the chowder a little thicker.  These are all just my personal preferences.  I have made this several times and have forgotten to review it.  It's awesome!  Thanks Pantry Chef Starkey."
101823,52,3/21/2006,5,"Excellent chowder.  This was the perfect warm-up at the end of a cold, snowy day.  I used more crab meat than the recipe called for, but otherwise followed the directions.  This was so simple, and worked well to put in the crockpot to keep warm while I waited for Hubby to come home for the evening.  We will make this again."
349752,53,4/7/2007,5,"Tasty, low fat, fast & easy!  I added 1tsp. of Old Bay Seasoning and 1 tsp. of Cajun Seasoning with a 14 oz. can of crab.  We all like the extra spice.  This recipe would satisfy DH & DS without any side dishes, but I offered saltines & a salad on the side just in case.  Definitely a keeper!"
446143,55,2/1/2008,4,"Oh, how wonderful!  I doubled the crab, and added some carrots (and some extra broth to compensate.)  We still thought there should be more crab though.  The nutmeg flavor was wonderful and the cayenne added a tiny kick.  Lovely recipe PCS!"
226989,55,3/7/2008,4,"DH and I enjoyed this. However I used it only as a base for a potato/seafood chowder. I made as is, except that I added about 1/4lb bacon, which I diced and fryed, tossed with 8oz crab the recipe called for and added about 1 cup pre cooked shirmp. Fryed them all together for a moment and put that all into the chowder. I also used a small can of creamed corn, as I'm not a huge fan of it. I think it needs salt for sure, I also increase the nutmeg and cayenne and added a bit of a chilli/garlic sauce. Good soup, I'll use it again."
868654,55,10/7/2008,5,"Along with the onions we added in a square of salt pork, and fried them up till they were crisp.  We loved this soup, and we will definately have it again when we get the craving for something to warm the tummy!  Thank you!"
1143059,55,2/12/2009,4,"I made this last nite and it was pretty good.  I will make it again, but am thinking it needs something else.  For one thing, there was no salt in the recepie and I did add that...I think next time Im going to add some shrimp and maybe more spices as I thought it was somewhat bland."
302867,58,1/5/2010,5,Delish!  Part of my New Years resolution....  rate recipes I've tried.  Substituted Old Bay for cayenne.  Will make again.  Thanks for a keeper!
1316788,58,2/12/2010,5,Fantastic! I used a little bit of cream since I like a thicker chowder. This was perfect though! A seafood party favorite!
1447190,58,3/18/2010,5,"really good,I did make adjustments to my needs I used soymilk,and left out cayenne,I added 1 box container of chicken broth which I think was 32 oz? I also chopped the potatoes and onions to a mush in a food chopper so it was easier on my digestion and I served over jasmine rice."
1003295,58,3/26/2010,5,"I might be slightly biased because I love crab in any and everything, but this was fantastic. I use cream instead of regular milk for a creamier chowder."
930021,58,6/25/2010,5,"My favorite chowder ever. I may try it with other sea food in future. I wasn't sure about the amounts of garlic and nutmeg, but they blend in really well. I added a couple of dashes of cream."
241697,58,7/10/2010,5,Really great recipe!! Although I did not have creamed corn..i added extra broth. It thickened up really nice!! Thank-You
980899,58,10/18/2010,0,"I used half cream and half 1% milk, added another 1/2c cream at the end. Was without nutmeg. Added nearly a whole pkg of bacon and two 6 oz cans of crab. I will come back to rate this after I make it again using all the posted ingredients. Really yummy, I need to add the nutmeg and see what that does to the flavor."
158966,59,10/20/2010,5,10/18/10 Update. I have to rave again about this recipe. I took the extra time to fry up some bacon and carmelize the onions in the renderings and still added the Old Bay and used the Cajun Seasoning in liu of the cayenne pepper. There were 5 people at the table but I expanded the recipe to feed 9.  I'm glad I did since nearly everyone had seconds. Even my super picky kid likes this!! ****************** 12/22/08: Absolutely fabulous!  This is  so easy to make and oh so satisfying.  I added a 1/2 teaspoon of Old Bay and used Cajun seasoning blend in place of the cayenne.  My nine year old son loved it.  Next time I will try adding some bacon like some of the other reviewers have done.  This is a keeper for sure!  Thanks ever so much for sharing.
827374,59,11/29/2010,3,"We made this last night and really enjoyed it.  I just used canned crab meat and honestly, it didn't really seem to add much flavor to the soup. But really, this can easily just be a chunky potato soup and would be nice and tasty.  I added about 1/2 a cup of thinly sliced carrots and 1/2 a cup of peas which added some nice color, texture and flavor to things.  In addition to the listed seasonings, I used 5 Pepper Seasoning and a few dashes of Italian Seasoning to add some flavor.   Also used 12 oz. of crab and 4 c. of potatoes and added about 1/2 of a cup both broth and milk to compensate for the added volume.  Came out with a nice thickness and is a stick-to-your-ribs kinda meal."
1719774,59,12/16/2010,5,"This was pretty good.  I could tell that my husband loved it.  Mine was spicy.  I think I added more cayenne and ground pepper than was necessary.  Also, I used pepper from a grinder instead of already ground.  I also used frozen corn instead of creamed, added more flour/cornstarch, and didn't have the nutmeg, so I didn't use it.  Thanks for the recipe."
49304,59,2/13/2007,5,Delicious easy to make soup which we really enjoyed. Cut the recipe in half & made it just like the recipe stated. This worked really good for our low fat/ low carb diet. I will defintely be making this soup often. Thank you for posting the recipe.
152118,62,1/2/2011,5,I enjoyed this recipe.  The only change I made was using frozen corn instead of creamed and vegetable stock instead of chicken broth.  I also added about 1/4 cup chopped shrimp since I had some in the fridge and a splash of half and half at the end.  A bit of salt as well. Yummy.
1781977,62,1/15/2011,4,"Very good base with many options.  First time I added lump crab.  Today went straight vegetarian and sauteed tiny diced zucchini, carrots, sweet red pepper along with the listed veggies (onion, garlic, potato); very colorful and nutritious.  Both times I also added additional sweet frozen corn for a little crunch and sweetness.  Loved the nutmeg. Both times I made this chowder I used 1/2 and 1/2 instead of milk and also added 1-2 TBSP of  sherry at the very end.  Very nice combination of flavors and textures.  As stated a above, a good base with limitless combinations of broths/stocks, dairy/soy, seafoods, shredded chicken, etc."
1874846,62,4/4/2011,0,"FABULOUS!<br/><br/>I could not afford any of the ingredients, so I just used what I had in my kitchen and that is the creamed corn. I warmed it up on medium heat for a few minutes and pretended that I was eating the Potato-Crab Chowder. UNBELIEVABLE! Thanks for this recipe."
1631574,62,12/3/2012,5,This is an excellent recipe for crab chowder. I followed the recipe with only a few changes. I added 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper along with the black pepper. I also added about 1/4 cup of sherry at the end of cooking time. We loved it!
1802624639,62,3/30/2014,5,"I like the nutmeg better than I expected. I did make a few changes. Added cayenne and used fresh crab meat (that I caught the day before). I also couldn&#039;t see making this without celery, so I added celery. One tip, cook this chowder a day in advance and let it set in the fridge overnight. Like most soups, stews and chowders, it&#039;s much better on day two."
1802697284,62,11/16/2014,0,Awesome chowder! I used both canned and imitation crab. The second added a lot of flavor. I added Old Bay Seasoning as well. Truly yummy!
2002097693,62,4/5/2018,0,Do you have cook the potatoes beforehand?
337963,62,9/19/2006,4,"The pepper and allspice, along using bacon grease to grease the pan, made this a very flavorful cornbread.  We enjoyed it!"
226081,62,6/29/2005,5,"this is my recipe from my website, www.finedinings.com"
185285,62,8/11/2005,5,"This recipe contained ingredients I knew I liked, in a combonation I wasn't sure of. *Trust me*, if you typically enjoy the bleu cheese, basil & crab - THIS is a your appetizer.  DH, who is very finicky about 'weird' combos adored this dish.  Hint: If you love basil, resist being generous as it competes with the bleu cheese - and that is the base flavor.  I spinkled bleu cheese ontop before baking as well.  This is a great appetizer - thanks for sharing!!"
180087,62,1/31/2006,5,"Great recipe.  We did use canned  crab, it was excellent.  Made the stuffing a day ahead.  We used med to small white mushroom, and found there was more stuffing than needed.  Crab around here is kind of $$$, so we will probably just make the bread crumb, bacon, & cheese stuffing next time, as we were just as satisfied with them.  Thanks for the recipe, the directions were very clear and it made for nice company appetizers."
240552,62,3/3/2008,5,"What a wonderful delicious lunch! I made the filling and put it in a portabella.  I used my own bread crumbs, light cheese, Franks Red Hot sauce as I didn't have tobasco so used more, and imitation crab meat as that is what I had on hand.  I ate the whole thing and am quite full!! LOL!  Thanks for the great recipe!"
446143,62,6/24/2008,5,"DH liked these a lot  Also used the filling in a large portabella cap.  I used an Italian cheese blend and added some mayo to the mixture, and melted some cheese on top too.  Skipped the egg and the wine, and used canned lump crabmeat.  Thanks!"
805572,62,6/12/2010,5,"The best stuffed mushrooms ever..fresh crab is a must, yummy!!  I will definitely make again, thanks for the great recipe =-)"
1802811100,62,6/9/2014,5,"These were a big hit at a recent party, and they went like hotcakes!  I didn&#039;t have fresh crab, but the canned crab worked.  They were still good, but I&#039;ll bet they&#039;ll be delicious with the fresh crab.  Either way, a big hit!"
263525,62,11/17/2005,5,This was really great! It turned out to be really savory.  I made a few adjustments to the amout but it was delicious. Thanks!
58439,62,6/9/2007,4,"GREAT hearty chicken soup, TRUE!
Does make you feel better too!
Comfort food as comfort can be!
Thanks for sharing this warming recipe!"
628951,62,11/13/2007,5,Very good and tasty especially when your craving soup on a low carb diet.
2854176,62,6/7/2013,5,"The best chicken and vegetable I have made! It&#039;s easy, very yummy and low in calories. Thank you!"
101732,62,11/5/2008,5,You're right...it's good!! The kids loved it! (So did I) I used lean ground turkey but otherwise followed the recipe as written. Thanks so much for postng! Made for My 3 Chef's '08.
52476,62,8/15/2006,5,"We have been eating this bbq sauce for years!  Fortunately for me I live in Northern Alabama and have access to the restaurant that originated the white bbq sauce (Big Bob Gibson's). It's my understanding that this white sauce is indicative only to Northern Alabama. The only way I have ever seen it eaten or have eaten it myself is with ""smoked"" chicken (either poured over the chicken after its done or used as a dipping sauce).  The combination of the smoked chicken and the tartness of the sauce is heavenly! I make this often in the Summer months and encourage everyone to give it a try!!  "
37722,62,3/12/2007,5,"This is excellent and the same recipe I've always used except that we increased the amt. of pepper slightly, and added a little sugar and salt to boot. Never tried the red pepper but will. I lived for 34 years in Huntsville, AL before moving to St. Louis, and our favorite place to have white BBQ sauce was the old Greenbrier restaurant on Hwy 20. There we douse grilled chicken with the sauce, but a major treat is their heavenly hushpuppies, to which we also add the white sauce. I grill skin-on, bone-in chicken breasts pre-seasoned only with seasoned salt and serve the white sauce on the side when serving. And Sally's right: the sauce tastes a whole lot better after chilling for a few days. Finally, don't buy commercially bottled white BBQ sauce; it's usually awful. Thanks, Sally!"
135470,63,5/5/2008,1,I did not care for this at all. All I could taste was the vinegar.
296027,63,5/19/2007,4,"Very nice,fresh summertime martini.  I will make this again tonight and update my response,leaving out the triple sec and Chambord as an alternative method for myself. I think I really like the taste of watermelon, so I felt the other two might have detracted from the flavor I was anticipating.  Triplesec and Chambord aren't my favorite flavors,so that part may just be me - others should make it as written and determine for themselves how they like it.  I LOVED the icy almost slushines I got from shaking the frozen watermelon too (DH helpd to be sure I was vigorous enough!!)....SOOO fabulous and PINK!!! ;)  Will be making again,in 2 weeks when my friend comes in town! Great recipe addition,Lazyme - thank you!!!"
82616,63,11/16/2006,5,"Ok, I made this last night durng one of my baking spree moments. part of it is froze and the other is GONE!!! This is a wonderful cake, great taste. I made no changes. Thanks lorrie :)"
92816,63,12/3/2006,5,This definately deserves 5 stars.I have made various Cherry Cakes and loaves over the years but this one is the best.I love the top on this.I didn't use any icing sugar but just the nice crispy top is so tasty.I also used baking cherries not maraschino.I'll be making this one every Christmas.Thanks for posting it.
593513,66,11/19/2010,5,I did write a review for this cake but it seems to of disappeared along with my private notes. I just noticed it because I was going to make it again this weekend. Must of went into that land far far away !!!!!   I found these very moist and delicious cakes. I had made 3 mini bundt cakes and 3 mini loaf pans. They turned out so good. At the time I didn't have the almond extract so I had used vanilla paste. This is definitely a recipe worth more than 5 stars.
1651233,66,11/14/2011,5,Made this cake this morning and it is so good! This recipe will definitely be a part of my Christmas line up. I made it in two loaf pans and they came out beautifully! I think next time I will replace the cherries with gumdrops and see how that goes. Thanks Lorrie!
9580,66,2/5/2007,5,"I saw this on 30 Minute Meals too!
This sandwich is amazing!  It is so good.  I omitted adding olive oil to the meatball mixture and the results were fine."
462571,66,7/5/2007,5,"These were a snap to whip up and were fantastic! I grilled the meatballs on the BBQ, setting them in a grill pan. I served the subs open-faced rather than topping with the other half bun. These made even tastier leftovers!! Thanks for posting!"
376098,66,8/1/2007,5,This was great! My husband said it tasted just like a chicken parm on a bun without me even telling him the name of the recipe!  We will make this again.
222139,66,9/8/2007,5,I chose this recipe from Fall Pick A Chef.  Could not have picked out a better one.  Great lunch dinner meal.  Because I made so much I will be freezing the chicken for later use.  Thanks for posting this recipe for us to try.
674484,66,9/15/2008,5,"Since this is one of my favorites subs, I decided to try making my own instead of going to the sub shop.  I REALLY LOVED this!  I put mine on the rolls, then added the cheese, put in the oven until cheese melted and the roll was toasted and crunchy.  What a great sandwich Jess!"
1251627,66,6/23/2009,5,"This recipie was so great, the kids loved it. I've also made it with chicken breast on a whole wheat roll for a healthy family dinner."
456221,66,2/20/2010,5,"This is a favorite here, too-- have made it several times.  This is also good served over pasta."
229619,66,6/26/2011,5,I was flipping through one of Rachael Ray's cookbooks and this recipe caught my eye so I checked and sure enough it was already posted here. I did use ground turkey instead of chicken since that's what I had on hand.  It was a hit here and I'll definitely be making it again.
280271,66,11/9/2008,4,This is so yummy. Quick to prepare and can simmer on the stove while you fix the rest of your dinner. It has a nice sweet taste that is not overpowering. Just right. We really enjoyed it. I served it with recipe #211485 and a baked potato. Thanks for posting. :)
305531,66,12/17/2008,4,Really good carrots! There were a great side dish to go along with some grilled salmon and rice. Thanks carolinafan. Made for I Recommend Tag.
1320855,66,7/12/2009,5,"I found this recipe by searching for healthy Indian foods. I was a bit skeptical of this recipe but I LOVED it. I was almost like candy, but for dinner and incredibly healthy.
I used extra virgin olive oil instead of vegetable, used 1 1/3 cups canned pumpkin,  chicken broth because I didn't have vegetable, sweet curry powder instead of the regular spicy kind, and the first time I made it I accidentally used ground white pepper (which has a sort of white-wine taste) and it tasted so good I used it the second time. This is a definite new regular meal. Thanks so much for sharing, I absolutely love it, especially the pumpkin-onion combination (which I'd never thought of before). One thing for anyone else trying this: my parents and sister hated it, but they are not pumpkin fans like I am. I personally don't think it tastes SUPER pumpkin-y, but that's just me. Try it out and see how you like it. I was really surprised to find that I was the only one who liked it, because it tastes like heaven to me."
345569,66,10/5/2009,5,"The last time I tried a bulgur / pumpkin combination, I was disappointed -- even though I like both ingredients -- so I was wary of trying this recipe.  But I am so glad I did, because it was wonderful!  I skipped the oil altogether and didn't miss it.  I also used a buttercup squash instead of pumpkin, and crushed bay leaves since that was all I had; and consomme instead of the vegetable broth.  The curry powder lent such a pretty color to the dish but the flavor wasn't at all overpowering.  Thanks for posting!"
278578,66,10/3/2010,5,"This is great, my first time really cooking with pumpkin. I subbed quinoa for bulgur and let it cook dry for a few extra minutes before adding the water (I didn't have stock). I added just a little maple syrup because it just seemed to be asking for it. Would make this again, thanks!"
1660185,66,1/30/2011,5,"Good flavor and my HS and MS kids ate it with no question! Probably better in the Summer sea on to have some great, fresh veggies with this.  Made mashed potatoes and green beans! Will do this easy, good recipe again!"
22174,66,12/28/2008,4,I am changing my initial review because they got better overnight! At first they seemed a bit blah but I just had one and the sweetness and flavor have improved greatly. Other great thing is these were simple and I had everything on hand! Thank you!
437991,66,5/25/2009,5,"What a nice change to the banana bread i used to make with too ripe bananas! The bananas were so sweet i  only used a little sugar and shredded cocnuts. Thank you for sharing, made for ZWT5"
423539,66,6/2/2009,5,"These are lovely cookies not bland at all. 
Of course I had to have one straight out of the oven and they were moist inside and chewy on the outside. The oats, banana and nuts really shine through.
Thank you iewe for a lovely recipe and one I will make often.
Made for the Dining Daredevils team for ZWT5."
1183623,67,10/28/2009,5,"so good!  i used applesauce in place of the butter/shortening and added extra vanilla instead of lemon juice, and 2 cups of oats just to thicken the batter up a little, and they turned out perfect.  i just wanted something different for lunch snacks and these seem to be a hit!"
495793,70,12/21/2009,3,"These were just so-so.  I agree with another reviewer that they got better overnight.  I was looking for a use of ripe bananas (instead of my usual banana bread) and I thought these would be great.  They are missing something.  The texture is okay, but I think they need some cinnamon or a little brown sugar or molasses, they were just a bit bland.  I think these good be very good with some work on the ""seasoning"".  Thanks for posting."
444132,70,2/17/2010,4,"These were wonderful cookies - I'm rating as a 4 instead of a 5, just because I think you need to make sure the batter is a little thicker, or they'll come out a thin and spread more than expected.  I love the flavour, and I did add 1/4 cup of cinnamon chips and the nuts used were walnuts.  I used butter, too, so next time I'll try shortening (or 1/2 and 1/2) and up the oats/flour if needed.  I think once you make these a couple of times and get the consistency down, they'd be the best thing in the cookie jar!  Made for Zaar Stars - thanks, iewe!!!"
669019,81,5/19/2010,4,"They're like banana bread, in cookie form. I added nutmeg - they would also be good with cinnamon and brown sugar."
678366,81,6/19/2010,5,We enjoyed these cookies and it was a great way to use the brown bananas. A little cinnamon is also a good addition. Made for ZWT6 and were decorated by DD.
522099,82,5/21/2010,5,"I really didn't expect to like this rice as much as I did.  It smelled wonderful while it cooked and tasted good by itself.  But what really brought it to 5 stars is the way it supported and elevated the dahl and mushroom dishes I served it with.  A wonderful complement to any Indian dish.  And the leftovers would make a BANGIN' rice pudding...
Made for Looney Spoons ZWT6"
171790,82,5/22/2010,4,What a wonderful aroma while cooking. Dinner guests rated this from 3 stars(diner prefers plain rice) to 5 stars. I've averaged the ratings. Made for ZWT6.
491979,82,5/24/2010,5,Perfect rice. We love Basmati RiceMade for ZWT 6  for Queens of Quisine
724516,84,6/22/2010,5,"Well I got perfect rice also, I served this with recipe#392938#392938 and the two went very well together. I kind of crushed my cardamom a bit to let the flavour out, you could really taste the two spices. A very nice recipe. Thank you for posting. Made for ZWT#6 2010."
480195,84,6/25/2010,5,The rice turned out perfectly and had good flavor. Thanks for sharing the recipe. Made for ZWT6.
852554,84,8/23/2012,5,This was great rice and I loved that it was made in my rice cooker!  I subbed about half the water with coconut milk as I had some leftover from another recipe. Made for ZWT 8
422608,84,2/26/2016,5,"I didn&#039;t follow the instructions exactly, but it came out awesome! Oh and my husband has no clue I put pumpkin in it. He can&#039;t wait to eat it again tonight!"
230860,85,1/9/2011,5,"These were very good.  Maybe my sourdough loaf was small, but I got 4 sandwiches out of this using the stated amounts for each ingredient.  I really liked the crust on the outside of the bread and the kick from the red pepper.  I also really enjoyed the flavors of the turkey, muenster, avocado and cilantro together."
1232945,85,10/8/2012,0,"Loved this salsa flavored meatloaf...tang is a nice touch, and so healthy:)"
27378,91,3/8/2002,5,This is also known as noodle kugle. I love it. It is one of my favorites.
35555,91,3/20/2002,1,"I found this pudding, extremely discusting.  It was way to rich for my taste buds, and it's texture was not one to my liking. Yuck!"
89210,91,6/8/2003,4,This is pretty good !! I used frozen spinach :( probably won't do that again ! next time I'm considering sour creme and poppyseeds too
227666,91,11/4/2005,4,"I halved this recipe, and it turned out pretty good, except for maybe a little too much vanilla extract for my taste. I might be making again for one of those warm, summer nights. :]"
53932,91,7/16/2006,5,"I also halved the recipe and not reading it carefully, used vanilla yogurt rather than plain.  I love vanilla so with the addition of even more, I liked this!  Perfect treat for a hot summer day."
442988,91,5/30/2007,3,"I'm sorry I couldn't give this a higher rating ... I appreciated the fact that this could be made so that it's virtually nonfat.  But I thought there was too much gelatin in it -- in fact, when I tried to pour the base mixture into the ice cream freezer, it had already solidified into a gelatinous, mass.  (I used Trader Joe's plain nonfat yogurt).  I'll keep looking for my platonic ideal of vanilla frozen yogurt -- but thanks for posting this!"
490060,92,6/22/2007,5,"i have had no problem with the gelatin, as another user has posted.  I have only had good results, the most fluffy, light, dreamy, creamy frozen yogurt I have ever made. DEFINITELY the best vanilla frozen yogurt I have had."
447165,92,8/28/2007,5,I halved this (except the vanilla- oops!) for my Cuisinart icecream maker as a couple others did-- great stuff!  We are excited to try it tomorrow after it's ripened too because the super-frozen parts left in the bowl were the best we thought.  We didn't find we needed to chill the mixture after adding the yogurt and vanilla because the yogurt came straight from the fridge.  I love that this is low fat and the gelatin insead of eggs which make me nervous to use uncooked.  Thanks Tom!
464253,92,5/6/2008,4,"On the first night, the yogurt was a great consistency, creamy and fluffy. Unfortunately, it got pretty hard and icy after sitting in the freezer overnight. Better than other recipes I've tried in that regard and maybe it just can't be avoided with home made. Definitely try this, it's delicious!"
176615,92,6/10/2008,5,"Excellent! Light, fluffy, and creamy, not icy like homemade lowfat frozen desserts tend to be. I halved the recipe and used the Cusinart ice cream maker. So easy and so healthy, I'll be making this often. Highly suggest Stonyfield Farm or other plain organic yogurt as the flavor and quality is so much better, in my opinion, than regular commercial varieties. Thanks for sharing your recipe! UPDATE: I make this often and especially like using Stonyfield's vanilla yogurt and serving with fresh sliced strawberries or other berries. Also LOVE this with a drizzle of local honey. Yum. To die for!"
1108690,92,1/2/2009,1,"What a disastrous recipe.  We used fat free yogurt instead of low fat yogurt which could have been the problem, but our concoction was anything but frozen yogurt.  It took a long time for it to finally become a consistency other than regular yogurt.  When it finally did harden, it was like eating flakes of sorbet. Very disappointing.  We will never use this recipe again.  However, we still are looking for a good fat free frozen yogurt recipe, if anyone has any suggestions.  But please, don't make the same mistake we did by using this unsuccessful recipe."
960426,93,12/16/2009,4,"Just to comment on 
Chef #1108690 's review.  There's no telling how much more gelatin you added to this recipe that was called for by using non-fat yogurt. 
That's how they make fat-free yogurt stand up without any fat.   That accounts for your flakes.  Delicious animal-bone-collagen flakes."
1320105,93,5/14/2010,2,None of my kids liked this at all.  It still had a bitter taste like yogurt normally does.  Nothing like the frozen yogurt from the stores.
386585,93,9/29/2008,5,"This is a great variation on the classic Reuben sandwich.  Instead of the tartness of sauerkraut, the sweet and tangy cole slaw mixture was a nice change.  It is also really easy to make, and I will definitely be having this again (and without the guilt of a regular Reuben)!  Thanks for posting, 2Bleu.  Made for Please Review My Recipe Tag Game."
2001891832,93,4/30/2018,0,There is no cooking temp?????? Love this recipe so I will assume it is 350?????
1202739,93,9/12/2010,5,"I am AMAZED at the people who DID NOT FOLLOW THE RECIPE, but chose to give it one to three stars.  The recipe calls for LOW FAT yogurt, not non-fat.  Another review makes the point that the reason non-fat yogurt is gelatinous is because of GELATIN!  The recipe was formulated for low-fat yogurt.  I make lots of substitutions in recipes, but I would never PRESUME to rate a recipe for not turning out well when I did not follow the directions.<br/><br/>I thought this recipe turned out very well.  As another reviewer, I halved the recipe because I only had a 32 oz tub of yogurt and was a cup short for the full recipe.  I used low-fat Vanilla yogurt and Splenda instead of sugar.  I also agree with another reviewer that it can go straight in the ice cream maker after incorporating the yogurt and vanilla.<br/><br/>This is very light and refreshing.  My husband and I like intense vanilla flavor, and by using vanilla yogurt and vanilla extract it was quite tasty.  I will definitely make this recipe again.  I think next time I may chunk up some fresh pineapple to drop in as well - I think the tartness of the pineapple would go well with the yogurt.  Cheers!"
12657,93,7/30/2003,3,"The instructions in this recipe are very lucid and easy to follow, but the end result was a little drier than I had hoped. The combination of ingredients worked well but it lacked the 'juice' that perhaps a chopped tomato could have provided. I topped this with a good amount of plain yogurt before serving and that did make it less dry. Thanks for posting, Karyl."
74736,93,3/26/2004,5,"Thought this was delicious Karyl, it's nice to know sweet potatos CAN be made without brown sugar or marshmellows! This recipe almost reminded me of some smothered hashbrowns we had that were enjoyed all around, only a lot less greasy:)"
1802694935,93,11/27/2014,5,I found this to be a very good take off on sweet potatos.  The use of olive oil was a good addition to this recipe that really made the difference.  The sweet peppers were also a plus.  For something different.  Go this one!!!
56112,94,4/18/2003,4,"Real good recipe.  Will definately make this again.  I probably will not add quite as much sugar to the next batch.  This one was just a little too sweet for my taste.  For those who like their coffee really sweet, it will be just perfect the way it is.  Thanks for the great recipe!"
29621,94,7/31/2004,5,"Thanks for the great recipe!

I used Splenda instead of Sugar, still Excellent!

"
537179,94,11/21/2008,4,Nice recipe! I scaled this down for 2. Was nice and easy. Great taste.
583401,94,9/5/2011,5,"This was delicious. I used butter instead of margarine which probably added a lot more fat then necessary.. but these are for my brother who needs the extra calories. Easy, fast, and tasty."
326970,100,10/27/2006,5,"I made this Jambalaya and we all loved it.  I didn't add all the cayenne pepper at once as DH isn't nuts about hot'n'spicy.  Used regular frozen corn rather than baby corn chopped.  Excellent.  My crock pot was too small so finished on the stove top.  Next time I make it, I'll cut it in half."
320245,100,9/29/2006,5,"Amazing - I always love your recipes, kittencal! I cook for very large groups on a very small budget, so in lieu of the zucchini I just added several cans of corn. Also (I'm in Switzerland), since cheddar cheese is expensive, I subsituted Fontal cheese in the dumplings and added quite a bit more cayenne than it called for. It was a hit! Thanks so much for all of your great cooking ideas!"
44642,108,10/19/2006,0,"Just posting, so I will know I tryed this. Never have found one of his recipes that I like. Did not make the polenta."
162191,108,10/20/2006,5,I loved this recipe.
137302,109,4/18/2012,2,This is probably one of those toppings which has to become an acquired taste.  It seemed to have an off taste to me that may have come from the cornstarch.  Honey is thick on it's own when cooled slightly and I think that if someone wanted their honey and butter mixed they would do better to just mix and heat them without the cornstarch.  Made for PAC Spring 2012
238496,109,10/4/2007,4,Delicious and fresh are the words I would choose for this recipe. I gave four stars because I like very spicy food. This is a personal observation only and not a critiscim of this recipe. I recommend it. My changes were to add a habenero chili as well. I sauted it over a low flame for 5-6 minutes. This kicks up the heat factor. Thank you lilchris for a great recipe.
424680,110,11/2/2009,5,"Made this with raw apple cider & my last bag of frozen cranberries! I used a generous tablespoon of minced orange zest ~ Very nice tasting sauce, although another time I want to try it mixed with a pint or so of homemade chunky applesauce! [Tagged, made & reviewed as part of my Sassy Sauces! theme in the current My 3 Chefs event]"
27443,110,1/15/2008,5,"If you like Reubens this is a must to try!  I can not say enough about this sandwich. Just thinking about it makes my mouth water. I made it as an open face, thus eliminating the calories etc of 1 slice of bread. Thanks for sharing your revision."
803511,110,6/26/2009,5,"Great Reuben variation!  I liked making the coleslaw/sauerkraut myself.  I added an extra handful of cabbage into the pot because it was cooking down so much it didn't look like enough for two sandwiches.  When I put the sandwiches together I only ended up using about 2/3 of the meat and 1/2 the cheese called for.  I shredded cheese off a block instead of using slices.  Lastly, I just can't give up my usual Reuben sauce (mayo, chili sauce, horseradish) so we subbed that for the mayo/mustard suggested in your recipe.  I think overall using less cheese and meat brought this ""lighter"" Reuben down even farther!  Made for PRMR Tag Game."
222564,112,10/25/2012,5,"Great, well balanced, sweet and savory, crispy salad with fruity apple cider vinaigrette. I was tempted to substitute apple juice concentrate to the apple cider to it's reduced quantity, but restrained myself and kept to the recipe."
222478,112,5/1/2010,5,"Very tasty! One thing I couldn't bring myself to do was combine the melted butter with the breadcrumbs because I think it would have made it too hard to coat the scallops evenly, instead I melted the butter along with the garlic and tossed the mix around with the scallops, then dipped in the breadcrumbs. It was much enjoyed over a bed of couscous."
780172,112,7/3/2013,5,This is a super easy dish to prepare. I felt it lacked a little seasoning so added a little Old Bay Seasoning. I got to use parsley from my garden. Nice way to make scallops.
1609258,112,9/13/2011,4,"Good but garlicy.  It didn't really have that umami taste that real boursin has but it is still good as a dip or a spread.  It gets better with age so don't judge based on how it taste straight out of the food processor.  I couldn't find the umeboshi plum paste but I did find some pickled umeboshi pickled plums that I tossed into the food processor with everything else.  If you can't find the plums, I think a good sub would be miso paste."
364211,112,9/7/2011,5,"WOW! What a sandwich. Loved, loved, loved the sauce. I did not expect this to be so good.  I would give this an 8 star rating if I could.  I used thin sliced whole wheat bread that I keep in the freezer because I don't use bread a lot.  Purchased the meat and cheese especially for this sandwich, except I made a mistake and ordered provolone instead of swiss.  I used a dill pickle relish that I already had and put a thin layer on the sandwich.  Next time I will make with the swiss cheese.  gailanng, thanks so much for posting"
4470,112,10/17/2002,4,"At the request of the chef  I reviewed the amounts of the ingredients and came up with the following:
1 can French beans or 3/4 lb fresh, frenched beans
2 14 oz cans Artichoke hearts
2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
1/2 cup parmesan cheese, grated
1/2 cup bread crumbs
2 tbsp butter
4 cloves garlic, crushed
1 can French's Fried Onions
Salt & pepper to taste
Followed the steps except for the fried onions I did not add them until the final 15 minutes.
  This is a very tasty recipe with a different veggie combination.  Easy to put together and great flavor..  The recipe had more bread crumbs in it than I used.  I think this would  be very tasty but I wanted to cut back on the crumbs and Olive oil. Thanks Kari for a lovely addition to my cookbook.  This is a 5 star recipe but because of the changes I made to it I rated it a 4 star."
22898,112,11/29/2002,4,I followed Bergy's quantities for this recipe so I can't give it a 5 but it is delicious and I will usee it again.  I do agree with Bergy that it is a 5.
873573,113,12/29/2009,5,"I love the idea of mixing artichokes with green bean casserole!  I made this recipe for my Christmas Eve dinner when I found out that twice as many people were coming and I didn't have enough food prepared.  This is quick and easy and tasted great!  I didn't have any breadcrumbs so I mixed in a little cram of mushroom soup to keep it glued, but I will definitely try again with the bread crumbs.  Nice play on the traditional casserole! =)"
68460,114,5/3/2003,5,"These cakes couldn't be quicker, easier and more delicious if they tried.  I used 1 pound of cleaned and deveined shrimp, then all of the rest of the ingredients exactly.  The sweet chilli sauce has the perfect amount of sweet and hot to it to give these wonderful cakes just the right tang.  My husband and I polished off half the batch as quickly as they came out of the frying pan!  We just LOVE these and I'll be making them again and again.  Thanks so much KitchenManiac...these are terrific!"
182292,114,12/23/2004,5,"Agreed: quick, easy, delicious. An entire platter vanished into a very picky Christmas party crowd, who all looked around for more. And that you can freeze the raw patties for quick cooking later is a huge plus. 

We substituted shrimp for the prawns, lime zest and juice for the leaves, used pre-crushed cornflakes (guessing that 2 c. of flakes crushes down to about 1/4 c. of crumbs). We also tried two sorts of Thai sweet chili sauce...one very sweet and mild, one very spicy. I advise using the spicy one in the prawn cake recipe and then serving with the mild one for dipping."
10033,114,7/8/2007,5,"Excellent recipe, loved by all. I had a hard time finding lime leaves in the amount of time I had to shop (I know where I could find them for sure but couldn't get over there before dinner), so I just left htem out, and the flavor was still very good. Thanks so much for posting."
82616,114,11/20/2006,5,"I made this up for Thanksgiving gifts. What a wonderful treat. Great mixture of sweet and salty, and I love the sympbolism of each item. This truly is a great ""gift"". Thanks"
125388,115,11/25/2006,5,"Wonderful idea for Thanksgiving!  I made these in Wilton plastic disposable decorating bags (to resemble a cornucopia).  I printed the blessing on the computer and stapled it to the top of each bag.  I placed one on the top of each plate on the Thanksgiving table.  We read this blessing as our prayer before dinner.  Everyone young and old alike, loved it!  I made 12 of these, and added each ingredient individually to the bags to make sure each bag got some of each ingredient."
35488,118,11/27/2008,5,"Thanks, NovaLee - I was having a hard Thanksgiving today, and came across this recipe.  Will make and give it with thanks for many Thanksgivings to come!"
262312,118,6/15/2009,5,"these were great!!  love finding new meatball recipes!  made as written but added garlic powder, parmesan cheese and used heavy cream instead of milk.  oh, and i added an egg. made up ahead of time and had chilling in fridge til i was ready for them.  thanks for a great meatball recipe!  will add to my keeper collection!"
4470,119,4/26/2006,4, Lovely flavor - I enjoy Adobo spice. Instead of scallions I used 1/4 sweet onion (just for flavor).  I found it a bit dry so I added 2 tbsp Ketjap Benteng (An Indonisian sauce) I like my peppers  crisp so added them for the last 5 min only . Instead of regular noodles I used Whole Wheat. Delicious dinner thanks Chef Christine
107135,119,4/14/2005,5,this is a nice recipe to have if you make alot of muffins like i do  i love your muffin recipes dee
209441,120,5/12/2005,5,"What a fantastic mix! I made up a recipe of this and stuck it in my freezer to use for recipes like muffins and cakes, brilliant idea KITTENCAL! and really great streusel too!"
52543,120,5/12/2005,5,"I usually have a batch of Healthy Bran Muffin mix (#114718) in my fridge; I now have a batch of your streusel mix in my freezer. These 2 mixes will be perfect mates for a quick, easy, tasty breakfast or snack. As usual, I used pecans instead of yucky walnuts. Thanx Kitten!"
235751,120,8/28/2005,5,"What a great idea and recipe! It would be a real time-saver when making muffins, coffee cakes, sweet potato casseroles, etc.  Thanks so much for posting - you've done it again, Kittencal."
86318,120,3/23/2013,5,"These noodles are wonderful! I did halve the recipe, and used snow pea shoots instead of gai lan. I also used shimeji mushrooms for oyster mushrooms, and dried rice noodles instead of fresh. The recipe doesn&#039;t list chicken stock in the ingredients, although it is in the directions. I used 1 3/4 cup stock for my half batch (though more might be better). It took longer than I expected for the dried noodles to cook, so I ended up cooking them separately, and putting the sauce over them in the bowl. Also, I don&#039;t know so much about cooking with black beans. I soaked mine in hot water, and then chopped them before adding them to the pan. It didn&#039;t seem to hurt. Thank you very very much for this delicious recipe."
397462,120,9/25/2008,5,"I made this a few days ago, it is one of the quickest dessert recipes I' ve found. My son who is my food critic loves this and has asked me to make another one. I made no changes but next time I won't bake it quite as long."
328099,122,10/5/2008,5,"Have had several gooey butter cakes while visiting our kids in St. Louis.  When I found this recipe, I was really excited--made it this past weekend when the St. Louis family was home--what a fabulous treat.  This will be made for many occasions in the future.  Thank you,"
403193,122,10/27/2008,5,WOW OMGosh !  nmlawrence Thank you We love this cake.  I have made this cake for years but in our resent move I misplaced it.  So I came to Recipe Zar.  For help to just make sure I didnâ€™t mess up.  These instructions are so well written and I think that the one thing that I never did is the secret trick to Perfect Ooie Gooie Butter Cake and that is melting the butter.  Thank you for posting and making my Gooie Gooieâ€™er  and my Butter Cake better.  Lori
61995,123,10/28/2008,5,"I have been making this for more than 10 years!  Mine is called ""Neiman Marcus butter cake, since it is so rich!  I use a 13 x 9 x 2 inch glass pan and have never had it spill over!  You can easily chance the flavor by changing the type of cake mix and extract!  I remember someone changing hers to Lemon and it went over very well!  I love it at room temp or slightly warm!  And cut it in tiny pieces!  People can take more than one!  I usually leave it in the pan and let people cut it themselves!  This is one of my top favorite recipes!"
440735,123,12/25/2009,5,I am from St. Louis and have grown up on Gooey Butter Cakes! This has got to be one of the best recipes for this.  I think the vanilla is the magic to it. This is a very sweet cake. I only put 3 1/2 cups of powdered sugar. Next time I will only use three.  I did use a 9x13 and placed it on a cookie sheet. It took much longer to cook as I expected but wanted to try it.  I took it out when it was golden brown.  I would agree with letting it completely cool.  Enjoy!
633027,124,12/29/2009,5,"My husband and I lived in (and loved) St. Louis for several years before moving to central Texas.  The food is one of the things we miss most about STL.  My husband decided he wanted to make gooey butter cake for our Christmas dessert, and since he couldn't find the recipe he's used in the past, he chose this one to try.  He followed the directions exactly and it turned out perfectly!  It's very sweet, melt-in-your-mouth gooey, and certainly addictive.  The directions were very clear and detailed.  Bake time for our oven was 40 minutes; we served it at room temperature.  We look forward to making it again soon.  Thank you SO much for posting this St. Louis treat!!!!"
543968,126,4/21/2010,5,"WOW!!! This is so very very very good!
Very easy to make.  
I actually forgot to put in the vanilla or almond flavoring. 
It didn't matter!
It was scrumptious.
I made it to take to our church Bible Study, as we eat afterwards.
Well, we made the mistake of trying it first, to see what an ""ooey gooey butter cake"" would taste like!
We then considered keeping it for ourselves, and buying something on the way, instead of taking it! LOL.
But I am going to take it.
And I know right now, there won't be any left! It just couldn't be better. Thank you!"
2100189,128,12/12/2011,5,"This is the same recipe that I used in St. Louis about 35 years ago, at age 10. :-) I am from Affton/Kirkwood/Glendale area & now reside in SE Florida. I lost my recipe & am thankful that you posted. Today I made small tartlets with this recipe & put almond filling & cherry pie filling in the bottom, spooned the cheese mix over the top & added sliced almonds. Baking time is about 20 minutes or so, depending on your oven. I also used Mexican vanilla. It is a great vanilla for baking use. The aluminum cupcake cups with the wax paper liners work great for sharing, once the tartlet is removed from the tartlet pans. I topped off with powdered sugar. The ladies @ the Cookie Exchange party I made them for were all a buzz with curiousity & they went like lightning. This is an excellent recipe and is really easy to make."
1701315,128,3/25/2012,5,"I grew up in Southern MO, but we often drove up to STL and would get fed Gooey Butter Cakes by our hosts.  I have tried far more complicated and time consuming recipes for them, and this easiest of versions has to take the cake...pun intended.  Wonderfully sweet and gooey with that most amazing phenomenon one calls a sugar crust.  Thanks for bringing back fond childhood memories!"
1351584,131,7/2/2012,5,"Delicious! But kinda on the sweet side. Instead of 4 cups confectioners sugar, I just put 2. Still tastes great. Just less sweeter. My kids love it"
7248862,131,12/5/2013,5,THIS recipe was the reason I joined this site! I too am from St. Louis and this recipe (as is) takes me back home. Will try other variations...15 STARS...GREAT recipe
2001338551,131,4/4/2017,0,Have made this cake often. Have added 1 1/2 c of mashed sweet potatoes to filling mixture with tsp of cinnamon. Changes flavor totally.
492343,131,12/13/2007,5,Yummy
1802406495,131,1/25/2014,0,"To everyone reading this. There is no such thing as St Louis Gooey Buttercake. Buttercake or Philadelphia Buttercake as we know, was brought here by the Germans bakers, that came over here. ButterKuchen came from Germany. Many of the German people that settled in and around Philadelphia were great bakers, butchers and candy makers amongst other thing. If you want Buttercake, it exists only around Philadelphia in its true and original form. It started where many of the German immigrants came to live &quot;PHILADELPHIA.&quot;"
1338623,133,2/4/2014,5,"Gooey Butter Cake is my husbands favorite and since we moved away from St. Louis, he has been craving it. So being the good wife I am, I searched for a recipe, found this one and made it for him. He LOVED it! Super easy to make and since he loved it, saving the recipe to make again and again :)"
91584,133,3/31/2014,5,Super wonderful recipe! Yum Yum Yum  :)
2000405375,133,8/15/2015,4,"I followed the (easy) recipe exactly, and it came out real yummy, but I was afraid I&#039;d done something wrong, because it really didn&#039;t rise much at all. It only came up about half way in a 2 inch pan. In comparing to other recipes, I found that other than adding a cup of chocolate chips and a half cup of butter to the topping, &quot;Paula Dean&#039;s Ooey Gooey Chocolate Chip Cake&quot;  is identical, and specifies a 9x13x2 pan. It&#039;s really a cookie dough, which shouldn&#039;t rise much. Omit the needless warning, and I&#039;d give it 5 stars."
2000488445,133,9/21/2015,4,Wow! This turned out perfectly!! My husband&#039;s been asking me to make a gooey butter cake for a while now and this was wonderful!! We&#039;re from the St Louis area and I try different bakery versions all the time! 2 thumbs up from this household! :)
2000780659,135,12/27/2015,5,Whoever invented this recipe is a genius. My boyfriend is from Texas and grew up eating this stuff. He talks about it all the time so I made a batch on Christmas. He said it was the best gooey butter cake he&#039;s had. Recipe is super simple and easy to follow.
571722,135,1/9/2017,1,"This was incredibly sweet, and I reduced the sugar content to 3 cups. I agree it is easy, but if there's a next time I would make it in it's original scratch made recipe, the box cake (though it was a healthier, non-gmo, etc) was just as bad."
2001403242,135,2/23/2017,0,"I really love St, Louis Gooey Butter cake, but I can only get it when I get to the city. I would love to be able to get it in my hometown. Where is that you ask? Farmington, Missouri it's about 80 miles south of St. Louis. I don't get to travel there but once every 3 to 4 yrs. To go to the hospital for test."
2001719206,135,9/18/2017,1,This was really terrible. It was overwhelmingly sweet and I used 3 cups of the confectioners instead of 4. And the cake mixture was bizzare. It was grainy and weird. I made it because I happened to have all the ingredients on hand but I wouldn't make again.
803102,136,10/25/2017,0,"this is the same recipe my mom used 45 years ago, now my husband's co-workers ask him to bring it for the staff pot lucks, you can use other cake mixes to chocolate, spice/add pumpkin to filling and pumpkin spice (that one is my favorite )"
2001782909,136,11/7/2017,5,"This was so so delicious! Our family enjoyed it so much and was gone in one day! It taste better then gooey butter cake in St. Louis where I live! It was not overly sweet and wasn't to gooey or to overdone! I would recommend refrigerating it, and you HAVE to let it cool!! For ours we had to cook it for about 20-30 minutes longer but, overall this was The Best Gooey Butter Cake that I have ever had!!"
2001861106,136,12/16/2017,5,"I first learned about gooey cake over 30 years ago while living in Florida. We took a batch with us up to our friends' cabin in the woods. They loved it! When they heard some more of our friends arriving they hid the remaining cake in their chest of drawers so they didn't have to share it! I'll be preparing five cakes this weekend to share with our neighbors. Thirty years is a long time to remember anything, so thank you for the recipe! I'm giving it five stars in advance cause I know it will be awesome!"
2002100759,136,4/8/2018,1,"I am from Missouri and lived here most of my life and never heard of this until about 3 years ago when I found them for sale in the Deep South. I thought they were of Southern origin. It is correct to claim this as a St. Louis dessert, but saying it represents the entire State of Missouri is pushing it."
43222046,136,4/10/2018,5,It’s a pretty close. But the 4 cups of powdered sugar was way too sweet for my taste. Next time I’ll leave it at 2 cups and add a bit of lemon juice to the cream cheese filling.
2000551249,139,7/11/2018,5,We have substituted a lemon cake mix for the yellow cake mix and it is absolutely amazing. This is a go-to recipe to bring a dish parties and bbq's.
2002265401,139,9/3/2018,2,I will start by saying that I followed the recipe to a T and I’ Sure it came out as expected but baby..... I felt the diabetes coming on after each bite. It tasted great but was just way too sweet. My 9 year old who could eat a bowl of sugar if I allowed it even said it was a “little” too sweet. I honestly would cut the powdered sugar measurement in half. Unfortunately I just dumped the entire lot of what was left after four family members had one serving each. Wow this is sweet.
2001205226,139,11/3/2018,5,"This is an exceptionally tasty cake! Very sweet, yes - just take a smaller serving. I am a chocoholic, and rarely care for sweets that are not chocolate. This cake is an exception - it is utterly delicious! You will not fully realize this unless you try it!"
450004,139,9/23/2008,4,"We really enjoyed this! We served it with Greek salad, and icy cold Retsina, from Corinthia! We were going to give it a 5, but thought maybe the sauce could be a little thicker. I will make double the amount of roux next time.  Great recipe, thanks for sharing it! [Made for Fall 08 PAC]"
73746,139,4/12/2010,5,"I have made these several times now and they are fabulous. This time I ran out of muffin cases so I made a dozen muffins and a cake and both came out lovely

Definately a 5* recipe"
461897,141,3/1/2009,5,"The best corn muffins ever! Very soft and sweet. The only thing I added was a touch of honey! I always double the recipe and the muffins fly off the table! Very very good corn muffin, tender and moist!"
242006,142,8/20/2009,5,"Last night I made cornbread using the recipe on the back of the box.  They changed it, because it was not this recipe.  The new recipe on the box sucks!  Don't make it, make this one!  Trust me, this recipe right here, is the ONLY recipe you'll ever need."
122877,142,10/13/2009,4,Insomnia struck so I made these this morning.  Simple and quite tasty.  I did add about 2 tbl of honey for a little extra sweetness.
362590,142,12/2/2009,4,Good recipe. Made them with 1 cup flour and 1 cup cornmeal and added 1/2 cup of raspberries.
250835,142,1/9/2010,5,"This is awesome stuff!  I used this recipe to make cornbread instead of muffins. Soft, moist and sweet.  Just an FYI due to a previous review: There are two cornbread recipes on the Albers box. One is for regular cornbread and one is for sweet cornbread or muffins. I've made both and THIS recipe is the way to go!  :-)"
857489,142,2/3/2010,5,"This is the only recipe I've ever used for cornbread. I used to make the Marie Callendar's mix, but not ever again once I tried this! It is awesome, so moist and sweet, like cake. I hate dry, crumbly, tasteless cornbread. I always use the square pan option, I haven't tried the muffins. I highly recommend using the albers cornmeal and this recipe!"
394077,142,3/21/2011,5,"My goodness these are so good!  I used buttermilk and they are buttery, moist, tender and perfectly sweeten.  I used Alber corn meal as suggested.  Keeper recipe.  Wow."
1879548,142,5/29/2011,5,"I made the flour and corn meal both 1 cup and soaked my corn meal in the milk first.<br/>I also baked them in a whoopie pie or popover pan for my son - he eats them like the Thomas' toaster cakes, they freeze amazingly well."
1056692,142,8/25/2011,5,"This is my favorite corn bread recipe!  I'm so glad to find it here already.  I actually had to dig my cornmeal box out of the recycling after moving years ago and cut this recipe off the side because no stores around me carried Albers and other brands didn't have this sweeter recipe on them.  I always put a touch of oil or shortening in my 10 inch cast iron skillet and heat it smoking hot while I mix this up so that it sizzles and crisps the outside of the bread when I pour it in, then I put it in the oven.  Great recipe for sweet cornbread."
269198,142,9/30/2011,5,These are wonderfully tender and sweet! I will never buy Jiffy Mix again because these are so much better. I served them with beans and we will have the leftovers for breakfast.
2000201349,142,5/13/2015,5,I cut this recipe off the Albers corn meal box years and years ago.  This has been my one and only recipe for almost 40 years.  My sons friends always wanted me to make them when they came out to the farm.  I get more compliments on these then on any other baking.
131126,142,11/6/2012,5,"Spicy, easy, and good!  I served on a TV night with a tray of oven baked chicken fingers, celery sticks, strips of red peppers, baby carrots, bread sticks, and boiled red potato slices.  It made for nice finger food, literally took minutes to assemble, and satisfied my blue cheese & spicy craving. Thank you for sharing the recipe!  Made for Fall 2012 Pick A Chef."
364211,142,10/21/2012,5,This does have a nice fresh taste.  I used cracker crumbs on the eggplant slices.  Thanks for posting Chef Curt.  Made for Fall PAC 2012.
2000431901,142,2/26/2016,4,Nice and easy. I used one big grocery store eggplant. Didn&#039;t soak it overnight and thought it was still tender enough. Added chopped fresh parsley after cooking.
1950221,142,7/6/2011,5,"Good recipe.  Great crumb and taste.  I halved the recipe which made some measurements difficult, but ended up with 1/4 c. coconut oil, 1/4 t. nutmeg and 2 eggs.  I also used almond milk.  DH liked, so will make again.  Might add some brown sugar for richness next time."
1759365,142,7/26/2012,4,"I gave this recipe four stars only because i like my muffins just a bit sweeter.  i think i will try it with a little honey or sugar.  other than that, they are light and airy and most of all i used up some of my fresh zucchini out of my garden.  Yum yum!!  i put half in the frig and half in the freezer and my daughter who doesn't have to be glueten free loves them and the fact they are so low in calories.  she sneaks one out of frig or freezer every time she comes over.  so give it a try, if you like it just a tad sweet, then add a little sweetness of some kind.  i will definitely make this recipe again.  thanks"
229448,142,3/5/2007,4,"This recipe was delightful! Very old world tasting, my husband refused to believe that apples and onion went together but this proved him wrong."
249623,142,6/14/2009,0,Sounds marvelous!!! I wish I could try this. Maybe after a few more pounds!
313120,142,9/2/2006,5,Very Good Soup.  Thanks.
158086,142,5/7/2010,5,This was a very good fast soup...I did not put any ground beef in it and I did not have any tomato juice so I used tomato sauce and watered it down...turned out great...
2060185,142,11/10/2011,0,I used this recipe to clean use up some foods I had in the freezer. It was great and quite simple. It was very hearty and everyone enjoyed it much!
445492,142,5/13/2007,5,Great recipe - amazing flavor.  Easy to make too!
89831,142,5/29/2007,5,"These were buttery rich delicious! I made these in a 13 x 9-inch pan and they baked out well, thank you for sharing Diana!...Kitten:)"
352538,143,12/1/2010,5,"Love, love these.  The rice flour gives such a nice texture.  Thanks for posting."
222564,143,12/23/2012,5,"Good, solid basic recipe. Turns out just like on the picture."
39301,143,9/15/2009,5,This was a huge hit with both of my kids.  Thanks for posting!
726344,143,1/25/2008,4,Have made these many times  very good
320640,143,2/26/2010,5,"Delicious! I was trying to cut back the recipe a little, but ended up just making the whole thing. So my bf and I have been eating it all week. But, hey, we sure don't mind. I didn't know what kind of onion or potato to use, so I just kept it common. I used small red onions and regular Russett, but I think you could get away with a smaller potatoes too. Serving 6 - so this makes a lot. Very tasty, thank you! Chnang na! heeehee"
134011,143,3/19/2011,5,Absolute comfort food!  Really yummy.  It also makes lots of sauce & was wonderful over rice & veg.  I also used 1/2 chilli powder due to younger family and it was nicely warm for our tastes.  Great recipe!  This is the last of 3 made for PAC 2011
280271,144,4/5/2008,5,"I have to give this a 5 star. I don't care for Quinoa. DH love this stuff. I prepared this for him today and took a taste like I always do...and thought ooh this is good. You can taste all the flavors, but the mint is most dominate without being overpowering. If there is a recipe that will make me a Quinoa lover this is it.... Made for PAC spring 08"""
351321,146,7/21/2012,5,"Love this recipe!!  This is the only recipe I use to make quinoa.  I omit the onions, because my husband is allergic.  So I usually add onion powder to make up for the flavor.  I always add more cranberries than the recipe says - just because I think they are delicious."
29782,147,11/5/2007,5,I absolutely LOVED this!! I almost ate the whole thing at dinner by myself :)  YUM! this is one I know I will make many of times. Thank you so much for sharing!
278639,148,2/4/2008,5,"I have made salmon patties from many different recipes, looking for one that I really liked, and THIS IS IT!!  It is my favorite, and so simple.  The saltines are what makes a great improvement in taste over other recipes.  Thanks, Cheri, for posting a winner (and so simple)"
693345,149,9/17/2008,5,"This is a great recipe! I have never made salmon patties before, and I am so glad I chose this recipe! I did add a few things, however. I added a shake of dried parsley leaves from one of the big honkin' containers, which probably equated to about 2 Tablespoons. I also added a couple shakes of paprika, for a little bit of spice (maybe about 1 tsp., or a little less). I also added a shake of garlic powder from the same type of honkin' container (probably about 1 tsp. or so). I don't really measure spices for stuff like this.... I dumped most of the salmon juice (eww...salmon juice) out, but I saved about a tablespoon and put it back in the mixture, just for a tad more moistness. I used canola oil to fry, and I rolled the patties in balls a little bigger than golf balls, then pressed them to about 3/4"" thick. Cooking time was right-on. My husband really liked them, and I did too. Thanks for the wonderful recipe! :)"
268741,150,3/19/2012,4,These turned out ok - you must SUPER FINELY CHOP the walnuts or the egg just kid of settled on the bottom- would have been good to have that in the instruction - but the taste seemed right for Persian sweets and I will try again next weekend for a Nowruz Celebration - Thank you for the recipe!
1480551,150,3/23/2016,5,"Lovely cookie. Enjoyed by all. Agree with previous reviewer. The walnuts must be chopped very finely. I didn&#039;t have the problem of the egg yolks settling to the bottom, but I think from a texture stand-point more finely chopped walnuts is better."
645231,150,11/28/2008,5,"I made this the other night for dinner and it was fantastic!  I serve it with garden salads and nothing else and it was plenty filling.  The only change I made was using extra cheese (wanted to use up the rest of the block I had), therefore I had to add 2 extra eggs.  I changed nothing else and it came out beautifully!  We love quiche in our house and now we have a new recipe for life.  Thanks Trinkets!"
200862,150,11/5/2011,5,"Trinkets, I apologise for having had to use zucchini instead of spinach -- our only decent shop had neither fresh nor frozen! I liked your recipe for its simplicity and creaminess!! Didn't change anything else (I used 1 cup cream and 1/2 cup milk). I hope 5 stars show up, because the new format and colours have me confused! This quiche is soft and creamy, and quite delicious. Next time I WILL do it with spinach. Thanks!!"
2001848839,150,12/10/2017,0,"Five stars for sure! Awesome! Substituted unsweetened almond milk, vanilla flavored, instead of regular milk. You have to try this! Was so moist and best flavor I have tasted. Great recipe! Thanks!"
107583,150,12/5/2009,5,"Delicious quiche!  I didn't use a frozen crust, but did use a ready-made one.  I also made this a bit ""quicker"" by using pre-cooked crumbled bacon.  I also added 1/4 teaspoon grated nutmeg, because it is a flavor I like in quiche.  Thanks for a quick, tasty dinner!"
2149976,150,1/16/2012,5,Great summer garden salad !!
487088,150,2/3/2013,5,"Lots of awesome goodness! So easy. I liked Mikekey's idea of using pre-cooked bacon and that did save some time. I always have that on hand. I'll absolutely make this again and next time I plan to thrown in some chopped spinach, I can also see using ham and cheddar cheese with some broccoli. So many possibilities."
461834,150,9/22/2013,5,"Wonderful quiche!!  I made 1/3 of the recipe and used a recipe from my &quot;Small Batch Baking&quot; cookbook for the pie crust which made one mini pie/quiche to serve two.  I served it with some fresh fruit and blueberry muffins, yummy brunch!!  Made for your win in the football pool game, congrats again!!"
176615,150,7/2/2014,5,Good simple to fix quiche. Made my own pie crust and cooked the bacon in the oven. Next time I may use green onions rather than saut&eacute;ed onion. Thanks for sharing the recipe!
2000688819,150,11/17/2015,5,"FANTASTIC!!!! I tweaked it a wee bit:  sauteed onions, mushrooms and spinach.  Then added this to the egg mixture.  Also used bacon chips - which is soy bacon bits.  ABSOLUTELY DIVINE.........."
615758,150,6/24/2018,5,"Made this for dinner last night and had it for breakfast too!! It is very good and easy to make. I had a frozen pie crust, made up the bacon and onion as directed, but I didn't have half and half so I just used 2% milk and it came out fine. I did throw in some cheddar and jack that I had in addition to the swiss and also some chopped spinach. It turned out terrific!! I would recommend to anyone."
655199,152,7/15/2009,3,"This was pretty good, but could've used a little more seasoning IMO...couldn't really taste the Worcestershire sauce. Granddaughter's (7 & 3) loved it! Will make it again, but will add some seasonings. THANKS!"
86318,152,9/11/2003,5,"This is a lovely recipe for hot weather. I cut it back to 1/2 pound tomatoes, which came to about 2 medium ones. It's such a simple recipe, but I don't think I would have thought to do it myself, and now that I've made it, I can think about adding other things...like olives or even anchovies. Thank you, Pat "
121690,153,8/1/2004,5,"Great recipe during the summer tomato-growing season, and wonderful for somebody like me who is avoiding salt. With all the herbs you don't miss it.  I used your recipe as a base, substituting fresh for dried basil, then added in sauteed mushrooms and zucchini and ate it over fettucini.  I'll definitely make it again!"
40114,153,8/5/2006,5,"This really is a lovely recipe. I don't easily give a five-star rating, bit thos one deserves it. Don't hesitate to use more tomatoes if you are a tomato-lover (like I am)."
1198738,153,8/7/2010,4,"DH really liked this.  I thought it was just okay.  However, when there is a plethora of fresh tomatos in the kitchen, this is an excellent way to use them.  Hubby even ate the leftovers cold out of the fridge, and he may have even lickied the bowl!"
362734,153,5/17/2007,5,This was a really fun snack mix. My kids enjoyed it and it kept them busy on a long car ride. This will be great for our hiking trips as there is no chocolate to melt. I used blueberry yogurt cheerios and chocolate teddy grahams.Thanks for this recipe!
285039,153,4/26/2008,5,"What a cute concept!  Never would I have thought of making trail mix with animal cookies and teddy grahams!  I, too, used chocolate Teddy Grahams but used chocolate skittles instead of fruit snacks and peanuts instead of raisins.  Kids love it! Thanks!"
369975,153,8/21/2008,5,A very popular recipe for a office party.  I also used chocolate Teddy Grahams and different character shaped fruit snacks.  Everyone was shocked that it was so good and so easy to make.  I will be serving this again the future.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe!
326787,153,12/22/2008,4,"Mixed up for a Christmas snack gift for my mother and father, something that sounded not too sweet. I did use the frosted Cherrios and chocolate Teddy Grahams as suggested. This sounded like a good choice, and I think it will be. Thanks..."
85707,153,9/11/2009,5,Easy and so cute!  We are having a family birthday party and there will be several little ones attending.  I made up a batch and tested it on my 2 1/2 year old grand daughter and 18 year old daughter.  They both loved it.
38643,153,9/13/2009,5,My grandkids had fun making and eating this today!
143917,153,10/30/2009,5,This is addictive!! I made it for DD to take on a road trip where it lasted about 20 minutes.  Sent some in a care package to DS with the same results.  Doubled the recipe but next time will have to quadruple!!! Thanks for a sweeeeeeet recipe!
103876,153,7/27/2010,5,"I pulled this up in a hurry today to make a relatively healthy snack-mix for our upcoming vacation.  We used chocolate animal crackers, pretzels, honey roasted peanuts, cheerios, raisins and fruit snacks.  It is very addictive!  Thanks for posting."
29418,153,2/2/2011,5,"I was searching on a snack mix that would be relatively healthy and fun for my three year old as she was getting tired of the same 'ole stuff... So I used chocolate animal crackers, pretzels, honey graham bears, honey nut cheerios, raisins and smiley fruit snacks...  It's very good...I love it and she seems to as well...Thanks for sharing!"
394543,153,12/31/2006,3,"I liked these but they don't rise 
much more than a couple inches
Atleast mine did not."
215969,153,2/6/2006,5,"I've made this twice now. Got it just right the second time. The recipe doesn't specify where to add the tomatoes, so I put them in with the zucchini and other vegies for frying. I found 1 medium to large eggplant and 1 zucchini is about right. The eggplant I diced and sprayed with oil and then microwaved for 4-5 minutes. The vegies I just fried with a bit more spray. The first time I made it I didn't remove enough of the tomato fluid and it came out a bit soggy. The second time I used phyllo pastry and made individual large serve pies. Rave reviews. Thanks so much for the recipe - this is definitely a keeper!."
234075,153,6/21/2008,5,"This was excellent. I microwaved the eggplant, like Andrea-Oz did, and used much less oil overall. Since I had fresh basil on hand, I used that instead of dried. And I had grape tomatoes, so I threw those in. I also used about 2/3 of the amount of cheese, to keep the fat and calories down. 
Finally, I used the Greek Baking Powder Pie Crust, Recipe #146530 , to keep it healthy. Awesome. Will make again. Thank you for posting."
2001782143,153,11/7/2017,5,This exact recipe came from a Betty Crocker Book from the 1970's. I could not find myt book so I checked the web. So happy to find it here. No tweaks necessary. It is perfect.
148715,153,12/30/2006,5,We did a large dinner party for my daughters 17th birthday.  Our theme was Greek and this dip fit the bill.  I shredded the cucumber and squeezed it so it wouldn't make the dip runny.  The dip was a hit and will get made next time I need to do a greek party.
953275,153,7/11/2009,5,"This just goes to show you sometimes DO need a recipe for the simplest of things!!  :)  Thanks Brew, this turned out really well.  I used balkan style (thick) yogurt and still drained it for the day in the fridge.  I also followed your instructions and seeded & chopped as opposed to grating/squeezing like I normally do.  It's really pretty perfect!  Thanks, won't go back now."
1206102,153,2/25/2010,5,"Delicious.  I did have real Greek yogurt, but no dill, so I minced some fresh mint (about 2 T).  Great with baby carrots!"
338384,153,8/15/2011,5,"I just noticed that I never rated this recipe and I must make this at least twice a month!  Seriously, I love this dip, especially with pita bread.  Thank you so much for sharing this with us!"
150281,153,10/12/2007,5,"FANTASTIC! I saved this for a special occation and it was a great hit. This is a great recipe for the autumn. My husband loves these, that is a high review in this house. I think this is a recipe that we will be keeping and using again!
Thank you for posting!!
PAC-Fall07"
803717,153,3/31/2008,5,I made these for a sunday special at the restaurant I work at. they are spectacular! I modified it slightly by making my own tapioca pudding (cheaper when you need to make a large quantity) and I substituted carmel extract for the brandy. they were served warm with sauteed granny smith apples on top and drizzled with a homemade carmel sauce....rave reviews from all of my customers!!! thank you so much for the recipe. I will definetely make these again!!!
269521,153,9/3/2009,5,"So simple and very tasty!   I cut the recipe done for two. Instead of canned green chilies, I substitued roasted poblano (diced) and used left over fresh sweet corn!  Also added left over diced chicken to mine (DH doesn't do chicken).  My process was  a little different;  I toasted one side of the tortillas on the griddle, flipped over; then added the filling and folded.  Served with fresh salsa.  YUM!    Thanks for sharing!"
246482,153,7/4/2018,4,Very nice I got 18 muffins out of it but I think my tins were smaller. Next time ill add a bit more coconut or sprinkle a bit on the tops before baking Made for world tour 2018 for the Pantry Pirates.
1145795,153,1/26/2009,5,"For my project on Ethiopia in world history, I chose to make the national dish.  The original recipe I chose called for teff flour but unfortunately I couldn't find it anywhere. 

Although I have never eaten authentic injera before, these pancakes came out nice and spongy and delicious!  Plus, the recipe was extremely easy!

5 stars! :)"
1110776,153,5/15/2014,5,Love it!
213139,153,7/19/2009,5,"Made for New Kid on the Block Tag.  These chicken thighs are out of this world.  I originally thought that they would be rather spicy, but they weren't.  Love the color that the cumin put on the meat and you could really taste it.  The only two things about this recipe are ~ the ingredients are not in the order that they are used (might be confusing for a new cook and thus I forgot the cilantro) and the sauce needed to be thickened a little, which I did.  Regardless this is a great recipe and I will use it again!  Thanks for posting this!"
829250,153,7/23/2014,4,"Made this because it looked quick! It was good!!! Didn&#039;t blow me away or anything. Thinking maybe tomorrow it will be better after all the flavors blend. There was a lot of liquid. Tried to add some corn starch to thicken it up but it didn&#039;t do much. Made with a side of beans and sauted red potatoe, zucchini, and carrots. Added sliced avacado too."
1170714,153,6/20/2011,5,This is excellent.  I cut the recipe in half and still had more than enough for what I needed.  I also used more powdered sugar than called for because I wanted a thick filling that wouldn't bulge between the layers.  I could eat it with a spoon it's soooo good!
1333844,153,2/26/2012,5,"I tried this filling and it was really good. I made a 1/4 sized recipe to try it and it was a lot, but was it good!? I followed it to the T and it turned out great. Will post pics soon."
63858,153,10/24/2007,5,"This was awesome!  We loved it.  Will definately make again.  The only change I made was I used dried cilantro instead of fresh.  Thanks made for PAC Fall 07.
Lisa"
128541,153,11/21/2010,5,This soup is absolutely the yummiest soup I've had!  So much flavor and so quick!  Thanks for posting it here!
133174,153,11/19/2017,5,A perfect soup for a cool autumn evening. I used rotisserie chicken breast meat and the soup was ready on the table is less than 30 minutes. It is well seasoned and something I am sure to make again.
865936,153,6/12/2010,5,"I made this into individual meatloaves and they were terrific!  I love Mediterranean ingredients.  I always think I don't like mint (in any form), but actually I do!  Thanks for posting.  This will certainly be made again."
1803719199,153,1/28/2015,5,This is my favorite meatloaf. We started buying half a lamb every year. I wasn&#039;t sure what to do with the ground lamb. So off I went to search out yummy things to make. I have made this several times now and it always is a delight for those I share it with. Super easy but oh so tasty. Thank you for sharing this.
2002330544,153,11/13/2018,4,"This is the best meatloaf I have ever made, Moist, flavorful, everyone loved it. Not 5 star because I am just conservative like that."
1235950,153,4/12/2009,3,"I followed the recipe as listed. Full of flavor. The eggs cooked evenly. I laid the steamer bag flat. The texture was spongy throughout and soggy on the bottom. Convenient way of cooking eggs, but I rather use a pan. Thanks."
592157,153,3/3/2010,5,This was simple to make and had a very nice flavor.
1600888,153,4/19/2010,5,Love this soup!  It's so easy to make and is very authentic!  Thank you!
766849,153,8/1/2010,5,"Yum!!!  I think this is the same soup my Korean friend used to order for me (she and the people at the restaurant spoke so quickly I couldn't follow any of it)... it came in individual bowls and we cracked a raw egg into our boiling bowls of soup... a great addition, in my book.  Thanks for posting!"
812019,153,1/25/2009,4,I picked this recipe from Recipezaar at the same time my wife picked it from BH&G. We make it with Chicken tenderloins and serve over rice.
136997,153,1/9/2009,5,"I love caremilzed onions, so I had to try this. Didn't change a thing. Delicious! :)"
160977,153,7/1/2009,5,"This is so good! There were two things that I did not have on hand. Fresh thyme and tomatoes. Solution: used 1/4 teaspoon dried thyme and 1/4 cup crushed tomatoes from a can. Worked perfectly. When the jam was ready it seemed a bit ""wet"", I decided to leave most of the liquid in the pan and scrape the jam together. Wanted to taste it as soon as it was done and found it a bit too sweet. But-once cooled (actually the day after) it was not overly sweet at all, had a jam-like consistency and a zing from the red pepper flakes. A little of this onion jam on a cheese sandwich, mmmmmmmmm.  It has many more uses but I keep putting it on my sandwich, can't stay away from it. Yes, indeed delicious. Thanks for posting."
601528,153,2/19/2010,5,I reduced the recipe by 1/3 with great success.  The only thing I would do differently next time is to chop up the onions instead of slicing.  It was a bit difficult to eat for me.  I thought this was delicious and went well with my tomato and balsamic vinegar chicken that I made for dinner last night.  I slathered this on some homemade rolls.
318262,153,9/18/2011,5,This was delicious! I didn't end up canning or storing any because we wanted to eat it all right away (I scaled the recipe down). I also added a tad more balsamic since I love the stuff and cut down a bit on the sugar. Topped burgers with these lovely onions. Thanks so much for sharing!
2633368,153,5/1/2015,5,"OMG!  This is SO good!  I didn&#039;t&#039; follow the measurements exactly, but it  was delicious!  Sweet and savory. SO good! I definitely plan to make this again! 
I didn&#039;t use tomatoes because I was all out. Maybe I will try with them next time."
323186,153,1/12/2009,5,"My first attempt at Bhaji, and certainly not my last,  these spicy treats were very straightforward to put together and welcomed by my DH who adores spicy nibbles!

That said, they are not overly spicy, so spice-lovers might like to add chopped chillies to this.

I used Pea flour, and I did need more than 1/2 cup of water, closer to a cup, eventually, although I added a little at a time until I had a thick smooth batter.   The veggies add their own liquid, so be sure not to make your batter too runny.

I shallow-fried these, and found they cooked easily, nicely crisp but a good 'spongy'  texture inside, I really was quite impressed!

Thank you for an interesting new experience, Pat!"
585496,153,2/6/2009,5,"Excellent recipe.  If you don't want to deep fry, sauteing also works (though it's not as tasty).

I have found baking the Bhaji, much like the technique you use for Nicoise Socca, also works well.  Mix all the ingredients and add 1/2 t. baking soda.  Put 2-4 T. oil into a non-stick frying pan, then pour in the bhaji mixture.  Bake in a hot oven (425F) for approx 20 minutes.  Serve in 'pizza' slices with a yogurt-coriander dip for an interesting appetizer."
320449,154,5/4/2009,5,"Great flavor!  I followed the baking suggestion, but baked mine for about 30 min. (in a 10"" pan)."
542159,154,7/16/2009,3,Really sorry we just did not like this dish. Tried baking it as recommend by other reviewers. DH liked the taste but not the texture. May be better fried as I think 75% of our issue was the texture itself.
527607,156,10/20/2009,5,"These are fantastic! I bought besan flour at a local indian market before i knew what to do with it, but am very glad i did.  Delicious and so flavorful!"
252514,156,9/2/2011,5,"These were very good. I loved the mix of veggies with the besan (chickpea) flour. They were not overly spicy either, although I did cut half of the chili powder and used curry powder in its place. I shallow-fried these in oil and drained them on a paper bag.  Note: this batter can be made a day a head and kept in the fridge. Served these with Recipe#326538, sauteed baby kale, yogurt, and peach chutney. It was a delicious meal! Thanks, Pat! [Made for I Recommend Tag]"
205750,161,11/6/2018,5,Really loved these. No doubt they can be tweaked according to taste and I am looking forward to making more in the future. I found they were still a bit undercooked in the middle after I fried them but I finished them off in the oven and they were great!
220348,164,5/13/2009,5,"This is for Zaar World Tour 5, and I am a member of the Dining Daredevils. I really love this recipe. I think the combination of nutmeg and fresh parsley is what gives this recipe a nice kick. Although I do have to say that because I love apples, it made it that much easier to enjoy this recipe."
744296,165,5/21/2009,3,Made this for ZWT5. Interesting combination. Didn't have the parsley. This went well with meatloaf.
542159,165,10/11/2009,5,"Tasty! How can you go wrong with cabbage, apples and butter. The nutmeg is a nice addition, how ever fond the parsley a bit distracting. We like parsley but felt that it took a way from all the other wonderful flavors. Made as written and next will do the same leaving out the parsley. Thanks so much for the post."
2324285,167,4/8/2013,5,"I really liked this side dish.  The raisins add just the right amount of sweetness, and although I used chopped cashews instead of pine nutes, I enjoyed that addition too.  A great way to dress up swiss chard- thanks for sharing. [Made &amp; Reviewed for Spring PAC 2013]"
21694,167,10/22/2001,5,"Very good, wonderful dinner during cold nights."
38492,167,4/20/2002,0,"Try this recipe using lamb to make it more authentic,the first time my Grandmother made this was the time i knew this was my favorite comfort food.saute the lamb in bacon,crumble the bacon and follow the recipe.enjoy."
39426,167,4/30/2002,5,"We agree, this was delicious! I would have added more meat and tomatoe but everyone agreed 'don't fix what isn't broken'. Even non-beet-eaters beat us to the pot for more!"
352483,167,6/23/2008,5,"This is my second foray into borscht and have to say this is amazing.  This is easy and fantastic as it stands.  If you like, add additional beef and/or tomatoes but this is a great recipe.  I highly recommend it.  And to think I'd been downright afraid of beets.  Thank you so much!"
459426,167,11/11/2008,4,Really tasty recipe. I added grated carrot too just to get a bit more fibre.  Thanks! :)
41578,167,4/3/2003,5,"I loved the combination of the white cheese and Velveeta!!! This dish is so smooth and creamy.  Easy to make and everyone loved it.  Thanks so much, TinaEmJer.  I have put this in my ""keeper"" notebook.   :-)

162939,167,9/16/2006,5,Pumpkie....This was delious. After trying several recipes for mac & cheese over the years I finially found one that we all loved. Way to go on this fantastic recipe. Thpse kiddo's are lucky to have a mom like you!!!
68460,167,12/20/2003,4,"Good soup!  I used 8 cups of chicken stock (from my freezer stash) and 2 cups water.  For the pasta I used 8 oz. of tri-color tortellini and the rest of the recipe I did as written, using low-fat cream of chicken soup.  Makes a nice big, flavorful pot of soup, we have enough for another meal.  Thanks Darlene, good recipe!"
41578,167,9/20/2005,5,"I have been in a soup mood lately and this certainly hit the spot!  I always have cooked chicken in the freezer and that is what I used for this delicious soup.  The ingredient ratio is perfect and I wouldn't change a thing.  You did it again, Darlene Summers.
"
75497,167,1/8/2008,3,"I loved this, but my daughter and husband would only eat a few bites, so I'm averaging that out to three stars.  I served this alongside mini Recipe #154943.  My raviolini had cheese and spinach in them, so I skipped the broccoli.  It was a great combination of flavors and easy to prepare.  I'm looking forward to having the leftovers for lunch today!"
149342,167,7/5/2004,3,Cook time on the broiling is a little long-- the ends of the legs got slightly burned.  Also a little more Old Bay seasoning (2Tbs) is a little tastier.  
223979,167,1/12/2009,5,Very good!  I love soft shell crabs and always have them in the freezer.  I followed the other reviewers advice about the Old Bay seasoning.  I added a tablespoon to the flour.  They turned out great!  Thanks!
8688,167,6/20/2005,5,"Delicious Pick-Me-Up! I made this using fresh blackberries with no changes to the recipe.  Thanks for a wonderful smoothie recipe, ocurt Schrock!"
59064,167,1/24/2006,5,Excellent recipe and you definitely get enough to make 2 thin crusts which meant I had one for the freezer. Which makes this recipe slightly more economical that most pizza bases as most bases take 3 cups flour per base. Great taste and texture - a good reliable recipe.
176615,167,9/27/2007,5,"Great recipe! I've tried lots of pizza doughs and this one is just wonderful. Very easy to work with. I used half for recipe #221973 and froze the other half for a pizza in the near future. Thanks for sharing your recipe! Made for PAC Fall 2007. Update: Thawed my dough and used it for pizza tonight. Excellent pizza crust! It's so incredibly easy having this ready to go, next time I'll take the chef's suggestions and make a dozen for the freezer. Second update: I made this dough again, this time doubled the recipe and used half white whole wheat flour and half unbleached flour plus a tad bit more water. Worked great for pizza tonight, and I have three dough balls in the freezer for future meals. Thanks!"
130819,167,9/29/2007,5,This makes for a great pizza! Have a really huge pan that is almost oven size - this dough was perfect for the making of a large thick crust pizza. Added all the favorites to top and everyone was happy. I intend to prepare and have crusts in the freezer. Yes will not only be making this again but will be passing around the recipe. Thank you for sharing this pizza crust recipe that has been added to my favorites folder.
253407,167,10/8/2007,5,"This is a very delicious pizza crust!! It was very easy to throw in the bread machine and all the ingredients are what I always have on hand. This dough is very easy to work with. I was very happy to get 2 pizza out of my dough, most pizza doughs only give you one pizza! We usually eat at least one and 1/2 pizzas and DH likes to take leftovers for his lunch! I will be making this crust again, I will have to try freezing it also. Thanks for posting a great recipe!!"
177085,170,10/1/2008,5,"This was so good, and very easy to do. The taste was delicious and was simple for a beginner at making their own pizza dough like me! This made enough for two pizzas so I froze one for later. We eat pizza at least once a week and this is now our recipe! Thanks for a great recipe!"
383346,170,10/25/2009,5,"DH rolled the dough and he told me it was very easy to work with.  And the crust was perfect, great taste.  Thanks FinFan :)  Made for Holiday tag"
289117,170,2/20/2010,5,"Great crust!  I did the prebake on the pizza stone for both crusts and froze one of them.  The other I filled with sauce, cheese, pepperoni and sausage and baked it at 425 for about 14 minutes.  Dee-licious!  Thanks!"
31316,170,8/23/2006,4,"I made this last night.  I had never had or made jambalaya before.  When I was cooking the veggies, tomato paste and 1.5 cups of water, the liquid vanished.  I improvised by adding a cup or so of chicken stock.  In the end, it tasted wonderful.  Thanks for sharing!"
1668373,170,9/26/2010,5,"very easy to make, and much tastier than store bought.  Wonderful!!"
461834,170,9/24/2007,5,"This is delicious and it is low fat!!!  I made one change to the directions, I cooked the onions in a couple teaspoons butter instead of dressing, as I felt the dressing would be too powerful.  I think next time I will cook the onions in the dressing, to keep to the low fat, but then leave the dressing out of the sour cream mixture.  I put the steak in the dressing in the morning to marinade and then grilled it that night.  Thank you for a great recipe nicole!!!!!  Made for PAC."
46357,170,9/15/2008,5,"Oh, this is YUMMY! I followed recipe exactly and it was all good, but the onions sauteed in the dressing were fabulous! I may make all my sauteed onions like this from now on."
1206102,171,12/29/2011,5,"Delicious!  The only change I made was leaving it chunky instead of pureeing, as we prefer our soups more ""stew""-like.  The flavors are subtle and seductive!"

171790,172,11/5/2007,4,I made this for last night's dinner. I used Dijon mustard in place of the dry mustard and I think that next time I'll use fresh garlic. Very tasty. A great way of using up left over pot roast.
46783,172,7/13/2007,5,"A friend from work made this and brought it for the other co-workers to try and everyone loved it!!  It has that caramel apple taste to it. Can't wait to make it for my family.

197277,172,10/17/2007,5,Random... ingrendients.. But very yummy! I had already peeled apples for something else and was out ingredients. I had this I cut it in half. It was very good!
519838,172,10/30/2007,5,yum!! This tastes like taffy apple! Everyone loved it and took some home! Update! I just found out that my friend also added an extra pudding box of butterscotch flavor and some milk.
180898,172,11/3/2008,5,This got rave reviews at my Halloween party from both adults and kids. My 10 year old DD made me promise to make this for the holidays. Thanks for posting.
53368,172,7/5/2009,5,"I've made this before and can agree that it is ZOMG FANTASTIC!  The recipe I used called for added banana slices and mandarin oranges.  Adding those could perhaps justify that it is a TAD more healthy, but of course we all know it's not.  XD  Doesn't change the fact that this is an AWESOME dessert."
1098889,172,12/3/2009,3,I had very high expectations but this was just okay for me.
724631,174,8/31/2008,3,"3 Stars, please see my rating system. I like all the ingredients, and I had never been let down by a TOH recipe, but this recipe as written missed the mark. I shared with my co-workers, and quite a bit was left over. I rated 3 stars because it was too bland, so I would not make it again unless I switched pepper jack cheese for the Monterey jack cheese (wouldn't most families prefer cheddar?), or switched horseradish mustard for the Dijon mustard, or served a bunch of different accompaniments, such as catsup, jalapeno slices, or cheese sauce so people could adapt it to their tastes. On the plus side, this was just the right amount of mix to fill a 13 x 9 pan (see upper left corner of my closeup photo).  A coworker took her piece home and stuffed in Pepper Jack cheese and bacon bits before reheating, and her son declared it a winner.  DH loaded on shredded parmesan cheese and reheated, and enjoyed it very much.  I conclude that one must choose some strategy to add a little zip.  Made for Photo Tag."
133174,175,8/11/2009,4,"The recipe is definitely a perfect after work meal.  The chicken was brushed with the pesto and instead of pan cooking, it was cooked on the George Forman grill.  I had a little difficult with the couscous as I wasn't sure what a sachet was.  I purchase couscous in bulk and attempted to make 2 servings.  It was a little gummy and something I would have to play with to get right.  All in all this is a very well flavored dish that made quick work of getting dinner on the table.  Made for *Aussie Swap*"
583349,175,6/30/2011,5,"This was great!  I loved the lemony twist added to the pesto.  I used spinach instead of arugula because the store didn't have any, but will definitely make again with the arugula.  I used only 1 cup water with 1 cup couscous since I don't know what a sachet is.  Thanks for posting!"
743849,175,6/22/2009,5,"I liked this recipe because it is basic and was easy to adapt to my tastes.  I used 1 15 oz can of red kidney beans and 1 15 oz can of white great northern beans (I drained and rinsed both cans).  I used a yellow pepper from my garden and added a small onion to the mix.  I used spicy sausage (would have been really good with kielbasa, too).  I sprinkled some creole seasoning into the beans while they simmered.  Finally, I served them over steamed basmati rice & garnished with some fresh, chopped green onions (also from my garden).  Delicious lunch!  I GNOME I will make this again!  Thanks for sharing this recipe, kellychris!"
68960,175,5/28/2009,5,"Awesome meal with awesome flavour!  This came together in no time at all for a filling, tasty, healthy meal.  Love the addition of the sage, rosemary and celery salt.  Mr Tender I'll put this one into our family members cookbook ;)   book #55856"
355058,175,5/28/2009,5,"Uncle Brent, I didn't know you knew how to cook!  5 1/2 stars from me.  This was very yummy!  I LOVED the nooooodles!!!"
731434,176,5/28/2009,5,Five stars from me!  I ate lots and lots!  I love you Uncle Brent xxx
424680,178,10/18/2011,5,Used Gala apples for these muffins & I was very happy with the results ~ Had some wonderfully moist & flavorful gems that were shared by several neighbors! I really enjoy making these kinds of special treats & do appreciate you posting the recipe! Thanks so much! [Made & reviewed for one of my adoptees in this fall's round of Pick A Chef]
705251,180,9/5/2010,4,This is a nicely refreshing beverage.  The flavor is very nice and unusual.  The coffee does not overwhelm the other flavors and the drink still retains its very pink color.  It is definitely going into my saved recipes folder to try again when I have some girlfriends over.  Thanks for sharing in Newest Zaar Tag.
128473,180,10/11/2012,5,"This was a nice coffee, so pretty.  I really enjoyed the subtle strawberry flavor.  The coffee shines thru in a subtle way.  Its rich, thick and creamy.  It was quick and really easy to make.   Thanks for sharing this lovely iced treat.  Made for Think Pink 2012"
25455,180,1/25/2002,5,This has been one of my kid's favorite cakes for many years.
35635,180,8/8/2002,5,"This is so good warm, love the topping..."
138799,180,9/28/2007,5,"Moist and delicious, this cake was so easy to prepare! The only change I made was using half brown sugar and half white. The topping makes the already wonderful tasting cake even more special. Definitely a dessert to serve company! Thank you for sharing! I made this for the Cake-A-Thon in memory of Chef-I-Am."
139930,181,9/29/2007,5,I made this cake for the Cake-A-Thon in memory of Chef-I-Am.  We loved it!  Simple to put together with items I always have on hand.  Cake was tender and moist.  Topping was perfect!  Cake and topping complimented eachother well.  This recipe is a keeper for me!
246197,181,12/18/2007,5,"Made a vegan version of this. I used 2/3 cup applesauce instead of the eggs, margarine instead of butter and soy milk in place of the cream. 
It turned out moist and delicious!!"
583502,181,2/9/2008,2,"this didn't work well for me :(
it was not ""moist"" it was downright soggy. the cake seemed okay when i took it out of the oven, the top and sides were dry and golden and it felt solid but when i put the topping on the margarine seeped into the cake and made it soggy, it also dripped off the top of the cake and went all over my oven. seems to be to much margarine."
2873848,183,3/15/2014,0,Every year for my birthday my mom would ask me what kind of cake i wanted and I picked this one ever time.  Im 57 now and my mom quit making me cakes years ago but I still love this cake.  I believe the recipe is exactly the same.
1802965531,185,9/21/2014,5,"Baked this for our church tea, only used 1/2 the sugar and used Oatmilk instead of Cream or Normal milk in the topping, It was a hit and loved by everyone, including the children."
222433,185,11/12/2006,4,Your right! This is really good. My teen boys loved it as well. The only thing that I will do different next time will be to make a double batch!! Thanks for the recipe!
1056692,185,10/27/2014,4,Very sweet and decadent. I might change the topping next time since my son didn&#039;t care for it. I love how moist this was without being soggy. My only change was to bake in a 9 inch round cake pan. Next time I&#039;ll try to cut back on fat by using applesauce instead of butter and maybe fiddle with the carb count for my diet. I did have some and it was worth the cheat tho. :-)
1363685,186,12/28/2014,4,Very tasty and easy to make!  Just be sure to use a 9 x 9 pan to avoid the dripping situation one of the posters had.  Can&#039;t wait to make it again...with some healthy substitutions and additions!!
1802637236,186,1/9/2015,0,Wonderful!  Lots of childhood memories with this fiber-billed delight.
1802849661,186,2/2/2016,4,"I&#039;d never tried Oatmeal Cake before, but I don&#039;t know why because I am a complete oat addict; I have oatmeal every single day for breakfast and this cake was amazing! I&#039;m not a huge coconut fan, even though the topping was delicious, I preferred it without, but that&#039;s just my taste buds! It&#039;s a great recipe! :)"
1122988,186,5/15/2016,5,Delicious and easy! Will make again!
2001184688,186,2/19/2017,0,I have been making this cake for 50 years and my Mother before. It is a great cake.
2757264,186,1/14/2018,0,Can I use steel cut oats with this recipe??
2002092044,186,4/2/2018,5,This is my husband's favorite &quot;birthday cake&quot;. I got the recipe from his mother when we got married and have enjoyed making it at other times when I want something quick and sweet. It is the easiest cake I have ever made from scratch and is a crowd pleaser at the office or any other get together.
6357,186,7/9/2002,3,"These were good. Since I like to make my cookies larger than the usual sized, this made 32 cookies for me. I did not grease my baking dish as the mixture already had enough margarine in it. I'm not too sure whether cake flour means the same as all-purpose flour ,or if the latter can be substituted for the former. But, I made this using all purpose flour and it was good. Thanks!"
227652,186,7/11/2005,4,This has a yummy vanilla flavoring to it. The cookie is very thin & flat so be sure to drop the cookies 2 in apart so they don't run into each other. I baked mine for 18 minutes since I like my cookies a litte soft on the inside yet crisp on the outside. This made around 4 dozen for me. 
650039,187,1/27/2008,4,Loved these! I use all purpose flour and only a dash of salt as my DH is on a low sodium diet. He loved them too. The go great with recipe #103024 Vanilla Pudding. Will surely be making these often .
1194914,187,7/30/2009,3,"Taste good, but they didn't spread well.  I think they might come out better with butter (in place of shortening).  I used All-Purpose flour..maybe cake flour would make a difference too."
80950,187,3/5/2004,5,I actually have to hide this from my husband when I make it.  This was easy to make if a little messy. I ended up using the Morton's Tender Quick Salt as I was unable to find a substitute.
340445,187,9/11/2006,5,"I was skeptical as I feared I would end up with 5 little baked meatloafs.  But not so.  The Tender Quick gives it the right color and texture.  This was very, very good.  I will definitely be making this again and again.  Thank you."
408221,187,12/15/2006,5,"I used more garlic (1 teaspoon per pound of meat) and it turned out phenomenal.  I scaled this recipe up to use 4.5# vension and 1.5 # chuck and the salt content was a bit much.  I will probably only use 4 tbsp. of Tender Quick for 7.5 servings, but it still turned out wonderful."
638020,187,11/5/2007,4,"Loved the recipe, as did everyone who tried it. I will be making this, a lot more often. Do not let the 4 star rating fool you, as I rarely if ever , give anything a 5 star rating. Love the recipe though."
652263,187,11/16/2007,5,"This is a very tasty recipe!
Last weekend was our first time making sausage. We used this recipe, some fibrous casings we bought off the internet, and smoked them in the BBQ for several hours and it turned out great!! It is a little salty at first but as it ages in the fridge the other flavors come though. I would recommend using a little less salt if you don't like allot of salt."
353131,187,1/20/2008,5,"This is an excellent and very easy recipe that gives as good as Hickory Farms results! DD(7) said it was""off the hook"",DD(9) said it was great and DH loved it He wants me to make more to give to some of his friends at work!!"
375730,187,12/1/2008,4,"This was our first attempt at Summer Sausage and it turned out great!  Ours turned out a  little crumbly but we didn't measure exactly so our ratios of meat could have been off.  We also cooked it longer because we were a little nervous at the short cook time.  We mixed everything in a ziplock baggie which worked great!  We found it difficult to get it packed tight enough and are planning to use soup cans as a mold, line them with tin foil and then bake.  Hopefully this works:)
**Note our butcher told us to spray/oil just a soup can pack the meat in and bake it-it should slip out-we are going to try that next."
983307,189,1/23/2009,4,Very easy to make and tasty too.  I used 1 lb. of ground pork with the venison instead of the ground beef.  Thanks for sharing.
326176,190,4/25/2010,5,"Wonderful!  We used all elk meat (no beef) and regular sea salt.  I generally 1/3 the recipe and make 2-4"" long rolls.  Everyone loves the great flavor.  I like the smoker idea that one reviewer had and will make a full recipe and do that next time.  Can never have enough of this in the freezer!  Great to take on camping trips."
1229480,190,12/6/2010,5,"This received rave reviews from my kids and extended family.  Be certain to give the ingredients a few weeks to blend.  We tried it within the first week and thought we'd made a mistake, however, another week or so and we loved it!"
66983,190,11/18/2004,5,"Fabulous!  These are the best brownies I've ever made.  I didnt frost them, didnt think they needed it.  I had never baked with melted chocolate before and it was so easy and tastes so good...I'm throwing that cocoa powder away!  Thanks Evelyn!"
65056,190,9/16/2005,5,"I was really stuck between giving these 4 or 5 stars, but after some thought, I decided that these were just as advertised (plain-old brownies).  These were a bit cakier than I like my brownies, but the top had this lovely crust that developed in the oven (as you can see in the recipes photo) that I really enjoyed.  I tried these fresh out of the oven and wasn't wild about them, but when I tried them the next day once they were completely cool they were much tastier.  I guess that's a good thing- brownies are only warm for so long, so I guess it's good if they're better cooled than warm! lol  The bittersweet chocolate really gives these great flavor, but I do think they're best cooled if you want the full impact of that flavor.  Thanks!"
41578,191,2/12/2005,5,"These are GREAT potatoes!  The only thing I did differently  was to double the amount of garlic...ahhh yes...and used dried tarragon (didn't have fresh.) Can't wait to use fresh tarragon from my herb garden.  I sliced the potatoes VERY thin and it worked out great.  Thanks for sharing, Boca Pat, this will make a repeat performance on our table again and again.
"
117438,191,5/17/2004,4,"These were really tasty and relatively easy to put together. The creaming was a step I am not used to with making muffins, and it did contribute to a cakey texture. I made 6 mega muffins and cooked them for 30 minutes. I also ran out of butter and had to use a little marg. Streusal is something I had not heard of before and even though I forgot the cinnamon, it really added a nice crunch. I also used frozen blueberries about 5 - 6 per muffin. Overall, very nice recipe. "
198601,191,9/3/2008,0,"These had a great flavor.  Not too cupcakey, although sweeter than typical homemade muffins.  Used almond extract instead of vanilla and would recommend that."
125636,191,7/31/2009,0,These did not turn out very well for me..they were so soft that I couldn't get them out of the pan. They were very very tasty though...so i would bake it as a cake ..but not as mini-muffins.
162398,191,9/26/2004,5,Def wouldnt make this for guests but he was severely hung over and it worked better than mcdonalds! Thanks.
190336,191,1/25/2005,5,OK - VERY GOOD HANG OVER FOOD! Better than a fag and Big Mac!
335363,191,7/31/2006,0," *****
Thanx soooo much for a grt recipe.My 3yr old asked for seconds-served twice this week-end for breakfast.I served it with sausages.
31/07/2006"
435938,192,1/28/2007,3,I made this for my very picky son - first time I tried I was out of milk and used dry milk. He did not like this! Next time I used fat free milk and he said it was good.
191809,192,4/16/2007,5,This was great!  I used cooked fajita-seasoned bell peppers and onions in place of the onion powder and the whole dish was really good.  I made wraps and really enjoyed this!
245429,192,12/31/2006,1,"Sorry, but we just didn't think too much of this recipe."
430471,192,11/19/2007,5,"These were outstanding. But who could go wrong with chocolate and peanut butter. I made a lower fat version of these, but will make the real thing at Christmas time.
I did have to use chocolate chips, because the store was out of the M&M's and I used almonds cause I was out of pecans."
8688,192,12/22/2007,5,"The perfect Christmas cookie!  I love the peanut butter and oatmeal combination!  I used old fashioned oats, pecans and regular sized M&M's which worked perfectly well.  I had to bake just a bit longer for the sides to bake, but I think my cookies may have been a touch more over the  1/4 cup.  Thanks again, Boomette, for another wonderful recipe : )"
166642,192,9/9/2008,5,These are delicious cookies. I used peanuts and regular-sized M&Ms. My family enjoyed these a lot and I will make them again.
491095,192,9/10/2008,5,I know these as Monster Cookies and they are GREAT!!
37305,192,12/1/2008,5,"Absolutely FABULOUS!  Temp, time and yield are right on (I did get 27 cookies instead of 26!) I used quick cooking oats and instead of adding nuts, I used crunchy peanut butter.  These cookies didn't turn out quite as wide as I thought they would (because they don't spread much), but they are nice and chunky plus chewy.  Really delicious!  These are definitely going on my Christmas trays this year...thanks! Update 12/01/08: I made these last night with Old Fashioned Oats instead of Quick Cooking Oats.  This time they spread A LOT!  I'm wondering if the quick oats absorb some of the wetness of the mixture, more than the old-fashioned do.  Either way, these are delicious cookies!"
303700,192,1/8/2009,5,"Made for Photo Tag. These bake up beautifully all toasted oats and peanut buttery flavour! I added a triple whammy by using Reeses peanut butter chips. As soon as I get a working camera,I will make them again and get a pic.
1/8/09
I made these again now that my camera is home again. :)
I used chocolate chips in place of M&M's and lots of peanuts leftover from Christmas.
they turned out just as nice as last time. Sorry it took so long for the pic, Boomie."
29655,192,3/3/2009,5,Great way to get oatmeal cookies into the kids.  I got absolutely no complaints!  I made them as listed without the chopped nuts but with chocolate chips.  They were a hit!  Thanks for a winner!
444132,192,5/19/2010,5,"Excellent cookies that are easy to make, and a real crowd pleaser!  I made these with regular M&M's, of which I only had 3/4 cup, so I used chocolate chips for the remainder.  The nuts I used were peanuts, which I thought would amplify the M&M aspect of the cookies.  These will definately go on my ""make again"" list!  Made for Sweet Traditions Tag.  Thanks for posting, Boomette!"
2000271443,192,6/15/2015,0,"Oh, forgot to add, NO FLOUR in this recipe???"
169430,192,9/2/2009,5,"I truly hate the tomato soup that you get in cans and have as far back as I can remember. When I saw this recipe I just had to try it and I'm so glad that I did. It's wonderful! I skipped the sugar, it truly wasn't needed and I had red bell pepper so that is what I used. The chunks of tomato, pepper and onion with the fragrant and flavorful herbs make an outstanding soup. At last, a tomato soup that actually tastes Great! Made for Photo Tag."
428885,192,1/18/2010,5,"Yep, that's right. This is one quick, pow-pow tasting soup. Easy as the flick of a light to put in the pot, and sitting down to enjoy the afternoon writing, reading, or relaxing. I followed exactly, using green pepper, and all the other ingredients which were so important to make this taste so smooth, so delicious, and so refreshing. I used fresh thyme from my green house, minced up and put right in. Served with toasted bread on top, where you can slurp up the bottom and make sure you have all the soup out of the bowl! Perfect! Will make again! Made for *Diabetic Forum* Soup's On January 2010"
157425,192,11/4/2010,5,"Fantastic tomato soup, so much better than the canned stuff! I used unsalted butter, vegetable broth, a red pepper, and petite diced tomatoes. Couldnt wait for the soup to finish cooking, it smelled and tasted great. Sliced a couple pieces of sourdough bread to go with the soup and enjoyed my lunch! Will definitely make this again it will be perfect on a cold winter day. Made and reviewed for Kittencal's Recipe Tag Game."
171790,192,4/5/2011,5,Wow! This has so much flavor! We loved it. It was served as written as a first course with tonight's dinner. I added some Creole chicken to the remainder. That will do for lunches for the next couple of days. Made for Kittencal's Recipe Tag Game.
869184,192,5/23/2011,4,We found this soup to be more like a minestrone than a tomato soup; I think that the bay leaf and sugar make it more mellow that a typical tomato soup. The tomato was not the predominat flavour which we had anticipated
498271,192,1/8/2013,4,"Great easy, tasty and inexpensive soup!  I used more than a dash of cayenne for a little extra heat.  Yummy and low-cal as is, I think it would be great with some chicken or turkey sausage added as well.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!"
870705,192,1/12/2013,5,This makes a delicious  soup.  I substituted 1 teaspoon of Creole seasoning for the spices but for us the tomatoes were a little to chunky......next time I would try mashing them up some but that's a matter of individual taste.  It was very easy to make.  Made for Football Pool 2012.
482376,192,7/22/2013,5,I loved this soup!! The flavors are absolutely perfect and I had no need to adjust the seasonings. I ended up blending mine until smooth. I will definitely be making this often. Thank you! Made for ZWT0 and the Soup-A-Stars
179133,192,2/26/2014,5,"I subbed orange pepper for the green and used vegetable broth. Otherwise followed the recipe but threw it in the blender once it was done cooking as I prefer a smoother tomato soup. Served with garlic toast, it made for a rather tasty dinner. Thanks for sharing!"
865936,192,3/17/2013,4,"I love the dressing for the rice salad and definitely use the sriracha. My chicken came out perfectly cooked and moist, but I think it would have benefited by being pan-seared before being placed in the oven.  Made for PAC."
560491,192,5/22/2013,5,"This was very good and light tasting!  I didn&#039;t use the sriracha but otherwise followed the recipe.  I did take threeovens&#039; advice and pan seared the chicken a little, made it look and taste amazing.  Will make this again!  Made for PRMR."
157425,192,6/18/2006,4,"This was a nice dip that needed just a bit of zip. I chopped the artichoke's rather small and omitted the salt as the parmesan cheese was salty enough for us. Next time I would use less parmesan, add some herbs, and maybe garlic and green onion."
731027,192,1/20/2008,4,This is how I like with NO mayo like so many recipes call for. I usually add about 1T or so minced garlic & sometimes about 1/2tsp dillweed....just perfect!!!
412530,192,4/3/2010,5,THIS IS THE ONE!  There are so many Mississippi Mud's on the site but most of them have a graham cracker crust. I don't care for it. This is the best crust with this desert. I couldn't find my old recipe but am happy to find yours with the same combination. Thanks for sharing.
1613349,192,6/21/2014,5,Yummy!  I used Tzatziki Sauce instead of greek dressing and added some hearty olives to the mix.  So refreshing on a warm summer night and easy to pack for a picnic.
267506,192,11/26/2005,2,"Was looking for a new version of my husband's favorite.  The cake had an overwhelming taste of alcohol, probably 1/2 C is too much Kirschwasser.  The frosting was very good however, we had to throw the whole thing out."
59144,192,2/14/2006,5,"DessertQueen, I made this recipe for my Mom and my Fiance' for Valentines Day, I added the drained Cherries to the batter and made it in a Bundt Pan. I drizzled Cream cheese icing on it & topped it with Chocolate Chips and Marischino Cherries and It was delicious!
Definetly a Keeper!
Thanks!"
56112,194,10/8/2006,5,"I knew that I would love this....I just wasn't sure that the family would...but they did.  It got a ""thumbs up"" all the way around the table.  I did add a few chopped mushrooms....I think you put mushrooms in everything!!!"
247368,194,5/11/2008,5,This is the simplest recipe for this dessert on Recipezaar at the moment. I followed it to the T and it tastes just like the dessert I love so much in the restaurants.
347922,194,4/25/2009,5,SOOO good. Now I can have my favorite dish from Berkeley's Thai Temple without having to travel thousands of miles!
1251273,195,12/22/2009,5,Thanks for a quick & easy recipe.  Made it a few times and found it absolutely scrumptious!!!  The different flavours blend in so well together.  I sometimes drain the artichoke oil to make it a bit healthier.
794242,196,1/26/2010,5,This is my all time favorite recipe that you have posted all of the flavors blend together so that it's like a party in your mouth!  Our family LOVED it and my daughter had 3 helpings of it and she never even gets second helpings.  Both of my kids asked me to make this sometime soon!
870928,197,2/28/2010,5,Loved this! Looking for something easy to cook for dinner and this was perfect! I will be putting this in my permanent file. GREAT MEAL!
96177,197,5/17/2009,5,"Dh and I loved his recipe. I didn't process in the blender as directed, in stead we added the drained ingredients into the skillet and added some cornstarch to thicken. Very good burrito. Made for ZWT5!!"
2083567,198,4/3/2013,5,"This is a keeper. I cut the recipe in half, other than that followed the recipe as prescribed, there was no need to process in the blender.Shredded the beef and put it back in the pot. The flavor was spot on! Leftovers were even better. Served w/rice and beans."
222564,198,4/2/2014,5,Grand as is!
138799,198,9/16/2008,5,"Delicious little buttery cookies that melt in your mouth! They're a snap to whip up because the cookie press does all the work! I made just a half batch and easily got over 4 dozen cookies, but lost exact count cuz I was samplin them! I look forward to using this recipe for the holidays and play with the different shapes, colors, and decorating them! Thanks for sharing your recipe tina rose!:)
Made for PAC Fall 08"
537179,198,9/24/2009,5,"Awesome! These were so good. Reminded me of those little danish cookies you can get around Christmas in the tin cans. I had never ever worked with a cookie press before, I'm so glad I tried this recipe. They were enjoyed by all. I'll be making them again. Made for PAC Fall 2009"
922195,198,12/24/2008,5,"This is really delicious and a crowd pleaser.  Made it for a Christmas party and the colors are quite festive, although I'll be anxious to try this in the summer when tomatos are in season and even more delicious."
318235,198,3/24/2010,5,"I had gone to post this awhile ago from my ATK cookbook and I saw you already beat me to it!This is excellent, though I did make a few changes in processes which I hope you don't mind. I only used one sheet of puff pastry and just smoothed the folds with my fingers. Then rather than cut off the side pieces I just folded the outside in about 1/2 inch the whole way around. I did poke thoroughly before baking but it puffed up a lot, which really didn't end up being a problem, I was just surprised by the size of it lol. To the tomatoes I added salt as well as sprinkled them liberally with garlic powder. Even though the pastry was all puffed up I just laid the tomatoes on top and once it baked the juices deflated the pastry a little. This was so yummy. I served it as a side to a steak salad and it made a perfect dinner. Thank you for the recipe!"
1041500,198,12/10/2008,5,"I made this recipe tonight and my son, a 6 yr old- who is a very picky eater loved it! Thank you so much for sharing."
1083594,198,12/18/2008,4,Delicious!
369715,198,4/8/2010,4,This was good an easy to make. I followed the recipe as written except that added some pepper to the mixture. I used a can of peas and carrots instead of mixed veggies. We all enjoyed this. Made for Spring PAC 2010.
1358170,198,8/20/2009,5,Everyone I have fed this too has gone absolutely CRAZY over it. I'm making it tonight for the 5th time in a month =)
424680,198,5/29/2010,5,"Really enjoyed working with the mustard seeds here & will have to find additional recipes in which I can use them! Glad that I didn't cut the recipe in half, because although there were just 2 of us for eating these beans, they didn't last but about 2 meals! Really enjoyed the combo of the seeds & the seasonings here! Definitely a keeper of a recipe! [Made & reviewed while in Asia with ZWT6]"
527886,198,5/31/2010,3,"Very mild. I would double the ginger and coriander, even for kids, just to have some taste beyond basic green beans. I only used 2 tbl of oil, and that was still way too much for this amount of vegetables. I would suggest the barest amount to saute the mustard seeds."
383346,198,5/31/2010,5,I used 2 tablespoon of canola oil.  And I used 1/2 cup green onion.  I didn't use salt.  I simmered the veggies near 12 minutes to have the green beans tender.  Cause I don't like when it's still crunchy.  This is really good with the lemon juice.   Thanks Momaphet :)  Made for the Zwizzle Chicks of ZWT
107135,198,6/1/2010,5,"ok i used canned beans  cooked carrtos 1st . cut down oil added drained beans last . i didnt add salt , personal for me . i know this would be great with fresh beans but was good with the canned  try this recipe .zaar tour 6"
895132,198,6/1/2010,5,"I had to use sweet potato instead of the carrot, but they do taste quite similar, so I don't think this makes such a great difference. Wonderful easy, quick and tasty green bean dish - I love green beans, and this definitely is a way I will eat them again! Thanks for posting.
Made for the Unrulies Under the Influence on ZWT6 Germany / Asia."
29655,198,6/2/2010,5,"Easy, quick dish with ingredients I already had on hand.  I loved this preparation for green beans.  I did use onion powder instead of fresh onion.  It was good but next time I'll use fresh onion.  The lemon juice really adds to the flavor.  Thanks for posting.  This is definitely a keeper.  Made for ZWT6."
844554,198,3/13/2011,5,Very good beans. Loved the spices and it's the first time for me using mustard seeds. I cut the recipe down for hubby and me and shouldn't have... we wanted more!! Made for PAC Spring 2011.
143721,198,8/17/2012,5,Great new way to do green beans.  I really like the mustard seeds in this dish.  Made for ZWT8 and The Wild Bunch.
166642,198,8/18/2012,5,"I love green beans and these were delicious. Loved the flavors and it was really quick and easy. Made for ZWT8 for the Diners, Winers and Chives team."
690623,198,8/14/2017,5,An excellent treatment for green bean. I will be making these often. Thanks for posting! Made for CQ4
227978,198,8/15/2017,5,"This was an excellent way to prepare green beans. I loved the bit of a kick from the mustard seeds. I'm glad I chose this recipe. It was really good. Thanks, momaphet. Made for Culinary Quest 2017 (Himalayas)."
226863,198,8/15/2017,5,I believe this may be one of the best green bean recipes I've had lately! We will definitely make it again. Even the non-green bean eaters ate this recipe. Thanks for sharing! Made for CQ 2017 for the Smok'in Chefs.
305531,198,8/20/2017,5,"We really enjoyed these beans. Simple but good. Thanks for sharing, Linda. Made for CQ4."
482376,198,2/9/2018,5,Really good beans and carrots! I loved the extra flavor boost. Thank you! Made for the Best of 2017 tag.
88378,198,7/25/2012,5,"Very good - we all enjoyed this.  I used just 1 jalapeno, and I omitted the ginger altogether because the heat level was perfect... which is to say plenty spicy.  I found it easy to mix the coconut milk and cornstarch right in the can with a slim whisk (save washing a bowl).  Next time I will add a little more basil to the dish.  This is a winner!"
2114486,198,7/4/2013,3,"I&#039;d suggest using green curry paste, rather than curry powder, for a fresher and more authentic flavor.  If you can&#039;t find Thai basil, again I&#039;d suggest using  regular fresh basil rather than cilantro."
900992,198,10/2/2013,3,"We added an extra jalapeno pepper and used Thai basil, but we found this borderline bland. It needs much more heat and flavor. I would probably throw in 2 or 3 Thai peppers if I were to make this again."
40804007,198,8/28/2013,4,"These crackers had a great flavor, but I made mine from regular almond flour and they were much darker in color than the ones shown. They froze really well too!"
2001676733,198,8/18/2017,5,This is my third time making this recipe. It's yummy!
956121,198,9/14/2008,5,"These muffins turned out fluffy, weren't too sweet and didn't stick to the pan.  I used 3 large bananas."
107583,198,9/18/2008,4,"These are very good, not too sweet (I used Splenda).  You should list Splenda in the ingredients list (it won't ""distort"" the numbers, since Zaar does not recognize it as an ingredient, but it would be less likely to be left out by someone not reading closely.  Also you have no oven temperature listed.  I baked mine at 350F.  I will be making these again, but will add some cinnamon and nutmeg also.  Made for Fall 2008 PAC."
962521,198,10/21/2008,4,"I thought they were great, though my sister didn't."
28649,198,7/29/2002,5,This was very simple and very refreshing.  This is perfect for this warm weather.  Thanks for recommening this Merlot.
30298,198,7/30/2002,4,Light and refreshing!  I used a reduced fat graham crust and light cool whip and still had a tasty treat!
87300,198,6/22/2003,5,"This is such a perfect summer dessert, and SO easy, too!! I made it as a strawberry lemonade pie, as my DH loves strawberries; I used 2 teaspoons Crystal Light (sugar-free) lemonade mix (same amount of water), light vanilla frozen yogurt (2 cups, which I think is a pint!), Cool Whip Free, and a Keebler reduced fat graham cracker crust (I couldn't find the larger size, but the regular one worked fine -- I just piled it on!). Then I sliced some strawberries into a bowl and crushed a few soft ones and sprinkled on a tiny bit of Crystal Light lemonade mix and stirred, then topped the pie slices with it. It was SO good!! And it reminded me a little of cheesecake, which I love. I recommend the strawberry topping if you like strawberries, as it added great color and flavor. The way I made it, I figure it as 4 Weight Watcher points (about 200 calories) per serving, for 8 servings. Thank you, Merlot!!!"
22973,198,8/11/2003,5,"Merlot,
  I took the ingredients for making this rcipe with me when we went camping last week,Soooooooooo GLAD I did,It was 95 in the shade andI made these.Ohhhhh My Gosh!!
These were so cool and refrehing,and so easy to make.Yum!!! Thanks so much,
Darlene Summers"
37449,198,8/31/2003,5,So easy and so good! My husband and son scarfed this up!
89831,198,3/15/2004,5,"Merlot...this is the second time that I made your lemonade icecream pie, it is so light, yummy and refreshing, my Dh just loves lemons..we had some company over tonight, so I made two of them in the morning and stuck them in the freezer (I will keep one for DH and myself).... they just raved about it, I sent home the recipe with one person, this is such a delicious pie, I can't wait to serve this at my BBQ parties this summer, this is winner, thanks so much for posting Merlot :-)"
101034,198,6/15/2004,5,"What a great tasting, refreshing dessert this is. It was heavenly. Everyone enjoyed it. I used a chocolate cookie crumb crust,  lite cool whip and sugar free country time. It was SOOOOO good. No one had any idea it was sort of low cal. Thanks Merlot"
95810,198,7/8/2004,5,This pie is so easy and so delicious!  I made a strawberry lemonade flavored one and used some strawberry cool whip with it.  Very good.  I also made a plain lemon one.  This is a perfect summer dessert.  Very light and refreshing. Thanks for the great recipe!
107308,198,7/17/2004,5,"Such an easy and delicious pie! We really liked the light texture and delicate taste of lemon.  I think one could add more of the lemonade mix for more intense lemon flavor.  I used a mild chocolate graham cracker crust (not the dark chocolate one) and topped with shavings of Hershey bar.  The pie looked lovely!  I am now wondering if this would work with the fruit flavored lemonade mixes?  Thanks Merlot, for such a nice dessert recipe!"
130819,198,7/25/2005,5,Added this one to my dessert table awhile back and it was an absolute hit with my guests. It is a perfect summer dessert. Since we love 'lemon everything' I already have requests that this be one of the desserts at our next gathering!  Thanks for sharing a recipe we all enjoyed.
229524,198,5/21/2006,5,"So easy to make and so tasty. Made Uncle Bill's Turkey (462620) for dinner and this was a very nice, light dessert to have.   "
130896,198,7/25/2006,5,"I tried this recipe because it sounded so easy, almost foolproof, and it turned out great.  It was very refreshing and not too heavy and disappeared quickly.  Thanks-Joan"
195175,198,5/21/2007,5,"I found this recipe in the new Kraft Food and Family Magazine and was going to post it, but I found you had already done so. Thank you Merlot. This is a great, and very tasty summer pie. I like that you can always have the ingredients on hand. I used lite ice cream and cool whip to cut calories. Yummy."
231054,198,10/25/2007,5,"I love this -- and idea behind it.  I'm sure you could use other flavors and still come up with a very refreshing and easy to throw together dessert!  I had Crystal Light lemonade powder and used it.  BUT I think I should have cut back to probably about half of the 1/3 cup.  It's VERY lemony!!  I used no sugar added vanilla ice cream and the lite Cool Whip.  I loved reading the other reviews -- and have picked up some good ideas from those chefs.  Thank you, Merlot, this is a fantastic recipe."
28201,198,5/25/2008,5,"This review is about a year too late!  I made this last summer, and loved it so much I must have made it a dozen times.  I'm hosting a grill out tomorrow for Memorial Day and I lost my written copy, so I logged on and saw that I never reviewed it!   This has just the right amount of lemony ""tang"" and yet it is so light and refreshing.  I also splurge and use Hagen-Daaz vanilla ice cream.  I'm sure I'll make this a lot this summer too!  Thanks Merlot!"
811602,198,6/24/2008,5,Terrific and easy recipe. I keep the ingredients on hand so that I always have a good dessert to take to someone's house. Everyone always asks for the recipe.
250031,198,6/26/2008,5,"Wonderful! Made this for my husband's birthday on this hot, humid summer day. Very refreshing, very easy--very nice!"
29404,199,7/1/2008,5,"What a tasty surprise.  I love it when super easy recipes taste super good.  TY so much for posting.  This will be a ""do-again"" and again, and again..........."
297380,199,7/9/2008,5,What a wonderful recipe for these hot days we are having.  Next time I will make 2 or 3 and freeze them to have handy.  Thanks for sharing!
381411,199,7/16/2008,5,We really loved this!   Very refreshing for the summertime.  I can't wait to make it again!     Thanks!
64583,201,7/1/2009,5,What a delicious pie!  I give it 5 stars even though for some reason my husband and kids weren't overly fond of it.  I've decided they must be crazy!  That's the only possible reason for not loving this pie!   Thanks for posting!
870928,201,9/17/2009,5,"OMG we loved this! Served to 4 people and everyone raved.  My DH said I can make this anytime.  Cool, creamy, and fantastic! Very easy to put together too.  This will become a favorite I'm sure of it!"
470894,201,4/27/2010,5,"so simple to put together and very refreshing.  I did add a bit more lemonade powder for a little more tang.  Use good quality ingredients and let them speak for themselves. In this case, less is more.  Thanks for the great recipe."
666947,201,6/6/2010,5,"This recipe is so simply and delicious! I used Strawberry Lemonade mix instead of regular and it was amazing. Thanks for sharing, this recipe is a keeper!"
804490,203,7/3/2010,5,"So easy and delicious!  Like another reviewer, I used sugar free lemonade mix - 3 teaspoons; same amount of water; and light homemade vanilla ice cream with sugar free cool-whip.  It was excellent!"
570804,203,7/26/2010,5,"What a simple and wonderful frozen pie - I thought that it might be too big for just the 2 of us but afraid I was wrong.   Disappeared in a couple of days.  Thanks for something easy, wonderful and light tasting."
791227,203,7/27/2010,5,"I have been making this recipe for years and it is always requested; especially in the hot summer months. Instead of instant, I use 6 oz. of frozen lemonade concentrate, and sometimes even deepen the hue with yellow food coloring. I also, ocassionally, make individual pies in the mini graham cracker crusts. This way, those not used are available for future desserts and their presentation remains intact."
257968,203,4/10/2011,4,"I also used frozen lemonade concentrate--a 6 oz. can, softened.  I also used slightly softened ice cream--2 cups.  I did have too much filling for my crust, but I just froze the extra for a snack.  Delicious, easy, and refreshing!"
195589,203,5/10/2011,5,"O Yummmmm!! LIke another reviewer, I used frozen lemonade concentrate. Since we are having a heat wave (in Feb.) here in CA, I made this a few days ago, and it was perfectly light and delicious! Thanks for posting, Merlot!  : )"
2001513060,203,4/29/2017,5,"This was a wonderful dessert. Just the right amount of lemon flavor. I made individual tarts, they came out cute and tasty!!!!"
61660,203,11/20/2002,5,"Most time consuming part was dicing the meat, but sure was worth it!  Everyone raved about it and I have already had requests for more."
323120,203,8/31/2006,5,This was dead on the the money.Almost the way my Babcia taught me.She never used Lamb or beef .It was too expensive!!!! Her insistance.
141293,203,4/18/2009,5,"Kim127 made this for Easter and was nice enough to give me a serving.  It is sooo delicious!!  I am making my version this weekend for my parents and I know they will love it.  I will be using lamb, beef, chicken and kielbasa."
45833,203,4/5/2003,5,DEEE-licious!!! My husband says it deserves 10 stars!! He asked for a piece.. then changed it to several pieces--for his bag lunch. I will be making this often!! I followed the recipe exactly--except for the pecans as I didn't have any. Thanks for posting!! :)
109395,203,10/26/2003,5,"This is a really easy cake for special events. Have made it for years. Try chocolate butter fudge cake mix with pecans and/or coconut in the topping part. The recipe we used didn't call for pecans, but I love them and add them as often as I have them."
10113,203,12/26/2005,5,this was a big hit in my christmas gift baskets the fist thing gone
366864,203,10/19/2006,5,"My mom use to bake a cake just like it she called it The Ugly Cake,this brought so many great memories!!!!!!!Try it, you'll fall in love!!!!!!!"
338672,203,12/5/2006,5,Just like the ones I used to eat when I lived at home. I'm so happy I found it again.
352814,203,1/7/2007,4,"Extremely sweet (a little too much so for my taste-just personal preference).  I also was expecting it to be a little more ""ooey gooey.""  However, it is very yummy."
473806,203,12/17/2007,5,Love this spin (nuts) on an old family favorite of mine.  Thanks for the awesome recipe revival.  EVERYONE who tried this loved it and wants the recipe.  Don't worry I'm giving you all the credit!
231507,205,4/29/2012,5,"Been making this for years, but could not find my recipe today. Made for a trivia fundraiser tonight and it was enjoyed by all at our table. Thanks Georgia Peach for posting!!"
1802878096,206,7/2/2014,0,"Not thrilled, my husband liked it but it was not near as good as that from my local grocery store! No crunch in the crust and no gooey center.... A little dry...... But again my husband liked it so not a complete failure!!!"
5060,207,6/16/2010,5,"Very flavourful chicken!!  we loved the basil and garlic and the prosciutto was a wonderful addition; the Parmesan was a perfect finish, thanks for posting I will be making this one again."
136997,209,8/29/2010,5,Absolutely delicious. I used fresh basil from my garden. :)
50472,210,12/19/2003,5,"Oh, I have eaten way too many of these!  They are addictive!  It was super simple to make.  The nuts turn out very glossy and shiny.  They look beautiful in a glass jar.  I must give these away before I eat them all!   "
47892,210,11/16/2007,5,"'Melon, I uses this recipe to caramelize hazelnuts and it worked beautifully. Do heed the warning in step #7 to avoid burning the nuts. Used local honey and Oregon grown hazelnuts. A million grazies!  cg ;)"
1091591,210,12/22/2008,5,"I made this recipe for the first time tonight and I have to say it was one of the easiest party/snack foods I have ever made, and they taste awesome!
 The Second batch I did however add a little cinnamon(about 1/4 teaspoon) and it was great both ways.
Thanks a bunch W.M.
Kudos"
1215879,210,3/25/2009,5,quick & easy...great in salads.
125356,210,1/16/2012,5,To dye for!
620435,210,11/23/2007,5,This was the most tender pulled pork ever.  The foil is the secret as it keeps the top of it from drying out.  I added a bottle of barbque sauce to the ginger ale so both cooked together.  The meat just fell apart and shredded very easily.  I then mixed in more barbque sauce after shredding.  Everyone love it.  Thanks for sharing this.  I may use the foil method when cooking beef in the crock pot as well.
765036,210,1/28/2009,5,I have made this recipe several times.  It is a favorite around my house.  my boyfriend loves it and we often have friends over when we eat it.  our favorite restraunt is sonny's bbq and this is just as good and alot cheaper.  thanks!
643099,210,2/4/2010,5,There is only one word for this pulled pork: FABULOUS!!!! It was incredibly simple to make and absolutely impossible to resist! I can't wait for those summer barbecue parties!
347441,212,6/16/2010,5,My son loves pulled pork but can't have barbecue sauce.  This has become his favorite way of having his pulled pork.   So simple to do.  Have used rootbeer and not enjoyed as much as this recipe.
1016302,213,7/24/2010,5,Simple and easy! After I pulled the pork apart I put it back in the crock pot with BBQ sauce for 1-2 hrs. Will use this recipe again!!!
1340977,215,3/12/2011,5,Two words...simple and DELICIOUS! Thanks for posting.
1181842,215,11/13/2012,5,"My family loves this recipe! Very tasty. The only variations i make are to cut up an onion in the bottom and set the roast directly on top of them (no foil). After 12 hours I remove the onions, shred the meat, add the bbq sauce and cook on low another 3-4 hours. My only complaint is the amount of time it takes to cook."
199631,215,7/3/2006,5,I have made this many times and got rave reviews
124190,215,5/20/2007,5,"These were very,very good. I made them on my indoor grill, and they turned out great. Very juicy. I did use a little less salt. I did have some trouble keeping them together, but I think that was my fault. I don't think I worked them meat togther quite enough. Thanks for a great recipe that I will definitely make again!"
567134,216,6/22/2008,5,These came out very juicy and tender.  This is a keeper !
278113,216,7/22/2009,5,"I really enjoyed these burgers!  We made two different recipes, and these were by far the best. Thanks for sharing this recipe."
322381,223,1/31/2007,3,"Very easy to make, very economical and it smells great when cooking. I don't know that we'd make it again, but it is a good recipe to modify to your tastes, like Silverjazz says. Love the addition of cayenne, and we put a lot. One thing though- I felt that it was more than 3 servings, just because it yields a whole lotta sauce!"
53959,223,1/29/2007,5,These were really good. I had a ham already in the oven so this worked out perfectly. Everything was done at the same time. I loved the cinnamon flavor of the yams. Thank you for this great recipe.
412186,224,11/8/2007,3,"Very good, easy to make."
326787,224,9/6/2007,4,"These are good, but maybe just a little too sweet for us. I only had 1 cup of cinnamon candies so that was all I used and they were still really sweet. Next time I will cut down on the sugar or maybe the candies. Just a note: We ate leftover potatoes a couple of days later and they did not seem quite as sweet after reheating."
803511,224,7/30/2008,5,Oh Twis...these are tasty.  I knew I would like them being a huge sweet potato fan and the cinnamon candies were such an interesting twist.  I ate them with a ham steak for dinner and then had another serving for dessert!  I think I might toss some toasted pecans in with my leftover potatoes.  Thanks for the fun treat.
297272,224,5/2/2007,5,"These were the best bran muffins I've ever made!  I ran out of applesauce so I used a small (mashed) banana instead of 1/4 cup of it.  I also replaces the brown sugar with 1/4 cup honey and added chopped dates!!!  SOOO moist, and the sweetness of the dates worked amazingly well with the honey flavour!"
356476,224,7/23/2007,4,"These were pretty good for ""healthy"" muffins.  I followed the recipe, but added 1 chopped apple, 1/4 cup raisins, 1/3 cup of chopped walnuts, and an extra 1/2 tsp of cinnamon. I'm not sure I would have enjoyed them as much if I hadn't added the extras.  I had to leave them in for almost 20 min, but maybe that's because of the extras. Thank you for the low fat/high fibre recipe!"
604139,224,1/22/2008,5,"These are a yummy, healthy muffin. I altered the recipe a bit: I used 1/2 cup whole wheat flour and 1/2 cup all-purpose flour, added 2 tsp baking powder, used 2 cups unprocessed bran, 1/4 cup brown sugar, added 1/2 cup raisins, and left the rest of the recipe as-is. They came out really well-the perfect amount of moistness, not too sweet but not tasteless at the same time. Thanks for a great recipe! I will definitely make these again."
1923002,224,6/2/2011,5,"Awesome, my whole family loves them.  I make them almost weekly.  I have used all bran, bran flakes, wheat germ and oat bran and they turn out great every time.  Also have added raspberries on occasion.  I have passed this recipe along to many people!"
310518,224,4/15/2008,5,"Wow!  This is the first Thai recipe I've ever tried.  It has a rather pungent fragrance, but is very light and refreshing.   I made it exactly as written except I used regular fish sauce because I couldn't find less-sodium version even in the Asian market.  It came out fine!  Very nice combo of flavors and textures.  We'll be eating this again! Thanks, Chef Romie.  Made for Pick A Chef Spring 2008."
604499,226,6/11/2008,4,"I give this recipe 4 stars because the combination of flavors is excellent!  However, I felt that the gelato itself was more the consistency of iced milk and lacked the creaminess of most gelato I have eaten previously.  I'm planning to play around with the gelato recipe a little bit and see if I can get the consistency to match that at my favorite little haunt."
144490,229,6/12/2008,4,"A few tweaks and this would be five stars for me. Flavor and presentation are fives, for sure! I made petite chocolate bowls using the balloon techniques as in Recipe #161209. 8 oz. chocolate yielded me 12 bowls. I searched high and low for espresso powder but couldn't find it. I knew instant coffee just wouldn't give the same flavor so I just used 2 shots of espresso instead. My gelato was lighter but the right flavor was there. I think I will substitute some cream for some the milk next in hopes of a creamier gelato. I adored the cinnamon cream, had to add a bit more cream as mine was too thick but I could have eaten a bowl of that alone. This would really be an impressive dessert for company as you can see from my photos. Advice though, do as much as you can the day before, it will make assembly much faster. Go Babes!  Zaar World Domination!"
337120,229,6/15/2008,4,"DD and I attempted this recipe for Fathers Day.  I agree with other reviews that milk alone does not create a creamy texture, so I might try with cream or half & half next time.  Also, we were not able to achieve a whipped topping effect with the small amount of heavy cream indicated and ended up using a pint (and reduced the cinnamon by half.)  We knew that the chocolate bowls were beyond our expertise so we made amaretto flavored chocolate bark with shelled pistachios which turned out great.  One thing we completely forgot when it came to serving time was the warmed nutella sauce, but none of us thought it really needed it anyway.  We loved all the various flavors.  Thanks for sharing!"
383346,229,6/22/2008,5,I loved the creaminess of this gelato.  Why buy gelato if we can do our own.  And this one is perfect.  I loved the taste of espresso and amaretto (which I added at the end when the ice cream was almost ready).  All the ingredients are made to be together.  This is pure heaven.  Thanks Babes.  Good luck!  Made for the Babes of ZWT4.
141569,229,6/24/2008,4,"I agree with wath others said, taste is great, but the consistency isn't great. I think you would need too make a custard with coffee taste and then freeze it. But as said, the taste is really good! Made for ZWT4."
987941,229,2/28/2009,5,OH MY GOSH!!!!!!! this is amazing. i will send it to everyone i know! I used whipping cream instead of milk and i halved the recipe since i have a small ice cream machine. But i will be making this alot it is my kryptonite. THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU!!
954555,229,3/10/2009,5,"You shound'nt be allowed to post these kinds of receipes, they are sooooo fattening, but OHHHHHHHH SOOOO good!!!!!!!!!
I made these over the wkend and they were a real hit.  Everyone loved them, as one of the members said, "" THIS IS PURE HEAVEN!!!!!!!!""  Thankyou soooo much for posting this wonderful receipe!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!UMMMMMMMMMMM"
93911,231,7/8/2010,0,"I haven't tried this recipe so I'm not rating it, but I just wanted to say that you can easily make chocolate bowls by dipping paper or silicon muffin cups in chocolate and letting them harden, then just peel off the muffin cup.  I usually dip once, let harden, then dip again."
27643,231,10/15/2002,5,"YUMMY!!! This is great! The chops are tender and juicy, the sauce is devine!! Such an easy recipe. The only changes I made were not using the pimento and I cut the peas in half. All I had to add was rolls and salad. This is definitly a KEEPER!!! Thanks RecipeNut! "
53522,232,2/10/2003,4,This recipe was very good.
2477403,232,11/1/2012,0,"Yick, yick, yick. No one in my family of five liked this recipe and we're pretty experimental when it comes to cooking. It was fast and easy to make. But we'll never make it again. Sorry"
840768,232,8/28/2013,5,"Tasty recipe. I amended it for the pressure cooker &amp; adjusted a few ingredients. Decreased the potatoes &amp; increased the mushrooms, peas &amp; worcestershire abit. There was quite abit of sauce so I will cut back the soup mixture next time (or sub yogurt for some to cut fat &amp; sodium). I also used fresh garlic while I was browning the pork chops to add more flavour. The combination of the pork with the potatoes &amp; peas mixture was a nice change &amp; enjoyed by all."
262966,232,4/18/2006,2,"Unfortunately, this turned out kind of bland for my taste.  I will try it again however, and add some tomato sauce and some crushed red pepper, as well as some additional tabasco."
58104,232,12/2/2002,5,"Quick and easy!
I also added 1/2 cup of roasted unsalted seame seeds and 2 tablespoons of honey.
Deliciously sweet!"
64154,232,1/10/2004,4,"The flavor was great. Unlike peanut brittle, it is loaded with the sunflowerseeds. 
The store only had non-salted dry roasted sunflower seeds. I felt the brittle could of been more salty. Salted seeds would probably take care of this. "
64203,232,3/2/2005,5,"I had a huge bag of dry roasted sunflower seeds in my pantry and had no idea what to do with them. I made this recipe and it was so good! My seeds were salted, so I think the flavor of this brittle was just right. It was so easy to make and it was easier to clean up after than I thought it would be too. I have more seeds and will be making this yummy treat again! Thank you!"
182809,232,10/2/2008,5,"Sharon, I both love AND hate you because of this recipe!  It turned out great and was loved by all that tasted it BUT......I too, loved it.....that's where the hate comes in.  I truly finished it up to the last drop, just what my figure needed, HAHA!  Neverthe less, this is a great item to add to your cahdy tray for the holidays."
186855,232,11/16/2008,5,"Perfect, and so quick and easy.  Wonderful flavour.  Thanks for sharing."
946146,232,12/6/2008,5,Diana #2 made this for me in the 2008 Cookie Swap.  Boy am I glad she did!  It was so good there isn't any left to share with company.  I guess I'll have to make some more :)
60124,232,9/2/2009,5,"utterly decadent! used a mix of sunflower and sesame seeds, I cant believe how good this tastes!!!"
895132,232,10/23/2010,5,"This was wonderful! I had no salted sunflower seeds and used 1/2 cup of erythritol and 2 tablespoons honey instead of the sugar, and it turned out soooo good! Thanks for posting this, I'll make it again and again!<br/>Made for Cook-A-Thon for Sharon in memory of her husband."
539686,232,12/1/2012,5,This is so easy and good. I doubled the recipe and it made quite a nice batch. I poured it out onto my Silpat sheet and clean up was no fuss. I'll definitely make it again. Thanks Sharon!
232669,232,1/2/2010,5,"Hello seemefli, I made these for the nursing home where I live - it is a Cuban facility and anything green gives them an allergy! (LOL) However, when we made these we sliced them very thin and as a previous reviewer stated, I added cilantro, red pepper flakes, a dash of nutmeg and Parmesan cheese. We also used some of the cheese as a garnish for the top. These tasted awesome, as I love spinach, but they were a great success! Thank you so much for posting, Manami :)"
398275,232,12/1/2012,5,"This was my first attempt at making brittle and I wanted to try it for three reasons.  First, I L.O.V.E. brittle.  Put whatever nuts in it you'd like, I'm going to eat it.  Second, I always have the ingredients in my pantry and fridge.  Third, and most important, it doesn't require a candy thermometer.  (They scare me!)  This recipe is the perfect combination of salty and sweet and one that will definitely be made for holiday parties.  I'll bet it would be fantastic with a light drizzle of melted semi-sweet chocolate on top.  I'll try that next time and let you know how it turns out.  Thanks for sharing, Sharon.  This is a keeper!"
522583,232,12/21/2012,0,"Simply wonderful... I only had unsalted dry roasted seeds, so I used salted butter... Great recipe for peanut allergies..."
573325,232,2/2/2013,5,"I had never made brittle before, because I was very scared of the process, but your recipe sounded so straight forward that I just had to try it. I must say, I will make this often again: It really is easy if you have time and patience. My sugar took ages to melt, but once it had melted, everything was so easy and quick and my brittle is already ready for eating. YUM! I used a chili flavoured oil to add a bit of heat and find it completements the sweetness from the sugar nicely. THANK YOU SO MUCH for sharing this winner with us, Sharon. I cant wait to make gift baggies with this.<br/>Made and reviewed for our VIP Veggie Swap # 55 February 2013."
47892,232,2/20/2013,5,"This recipe was cut in half although the amount of butter was doubled from 1 tablespoon to 2 tablespoons. I also added 1/4 teaspoon pure vanilla extract and most importantly used two teflon pans to melt the butter and the sugar (made for much easier clean up-NO scrubbing of pans!)  Instead of buttering a baking sheet, I lined an 8"" square Pyrex pan with parchment paper and used a small piece of parchment paper to spread and smooth the top of the brittle. This part must be done quickly before the mixture hardens but carefully so as not to burn yourself. Looking forward to all kinds of variations of this recipe! Made for SUN & SPICE Event/Veg Tag February."
26637,232,9/9/2014,5,"This was my first attempt at brittle of any kind.  I was pleased with the results and it was much easier than I expected. I like that it doesn&#039;t require a candy thermometer.   I will keep this recipe and definitely make it again. I would like to try some of the seasonings suggested by other reviewers, just for a different taste.  But this was a big hit at my sunflower themed event."
2000331850,232,7/11/2015,4,"I was delighted to discover this simple, delicious recipe. A great change from peanut butter brittle."
13483,232,5/15/2005,5,"Well these are just gems.  They are so much better than ordinary baked potatoes with sour cream in my opinion!!  If you're baking 'em anyway why not smash 'em!!  I did not have fenned seeds but I did use some celery seeds, granulated garlic, carraway seeds and parmesan cheese with the olive oil.  Just terrific.  Thank you CookingMonster."
60486,232,9/1/2008,5,"Very good. I was looking for a fennel recipe and thought this looked interesting. Super simple and easy. Made no changes or substitutions. Served with recipe #113483 and recipe #237133. I can see myself preparing these again, and trying some of the variations. Had some leftovers which reheated well: microwave until lukewarm and put in toaster oven at 450-500 for approx. 5mins."
37449,236,11/3/2008,5,I used fingerling potatoes and enjoyed them! Thanks!
1111928,236,6/14/2010,5,Very good. However I did tweek it a little since I don't really care for fennel. I drizzled the potatoes with basil flavored olive oil and topped with cheddar cheese and fresh chives out of my garden.
2503874,236,11/16/2012,4,set up beautifully once it was completely cool. I added a sprinkle of nutmeg on top and loved the added flavor.
197788,238,6/13/2007,4,This was tasty! I left out the zucchini as we don't like it. The only problem I had was I didn't have a lid for my cast iron skillet so I just put tinfoil over it.
445432,238,4/1/2007,4,"Halved the recipe and baked in 13x9 pyrex dish. Watched the batter rising in the oven and thought I had totally ruined them but the middle sank as they cooled. Tasted close to the ones I had in elementary school but I will definately cut back on the sugar. My DD ate them for breakfast : )
Edit:  Had a couple other people try them this w/e and they thought they tasted like the ones we had in elementary school."
124449,238,5/3/2007,5,"This was very good, and just enough different from the way I normally make ham salad to make it worthwhile!  I did add 2 hard boiled eggs, and used sweet pickles rather than pickle relish, just because of personal preferences.  I will definitely make this one again!  Thanks for posting!"
237951,240,8/1/2008,5,"Hurray! A new salad for DH to have for lunch sometimes!  He's happy and so am I.  He doesn't like mayo or vinegar type dressings much, so this was a wonderful discovery for us.  I might try the dressing on chicken---if I do, I'll let you know how we liked it.  Thanks."
1198780,240,3/10/2009,0,"I have tried this recipe several times and it has turned out great, and enjoyed by everyone.  I use baby spinach, so that I can skip direction # 2.  I have also added 4 green chillies and 1/2 cup chopped corriander; a dash of pepper and 1/2 cup Grana Padano parmesan cheese.  I save some of the shredded mozzarella to sprinkle on the top.  My family refers to this as ""Spinach Squares"" and it is surely a delish one!!!"
1239906,240,9/8/2014,5,"This dish is even better at room temperature or cold than it is hot.  I used frozen spinach (thawed and squeezed out) and sauteed the onion with a few cloves of minced garlic before adding them to the mix.  The squares have a pie crust taste about them after baked, similar to a quiche.  I halved the recipe and used a square baking pan, same cooking time, and they turned out perfectly."
62264,240,5/15/2008,5,Wonderful recipe! Cut 2 whole breasts from a bird into strips & proceded as directed. Doubled sauce & added about a teaspoon of fennel seed. Got pulled away from stove so added a cup of chardonnay & let simmer after step 7. Added 1/2 cup fresh chopped Italian parsley a couple of minutes before plating. Served as suggested with rigatoni. Otstanding piquant gently tempered by the balsamic vinegar. I can't wait to make with garden fresh tomatoes & basil w/o interruption this summer. Thank you Alotizzi for a real keeper!
818279,240,11/23/2009,5,Nobody can eat just one!  These were yummy delicious little morsels.  At first people thought they were small peanut butter cookies because I did the cross-hatch with a fork.  Next time I'll roll out thin and cut into squares.  DELICIOUS recipe.  I didn't change a thing.  Thanks for sharing!
1900993,240,4/17/2012,5,A very light and moist cake with chocolate chips and cinnamon giving it a suitable icing that adds to the flavour of this delightful cake that I made one substitution for with pure cane sugar instead of honey which does not alter the final results of the cake
599450,240,9/13/2009,4,"We loved this. Very quick to put together and the hint of red pepper sauce was perfect! Thanks, cookiemakin'mama! Made for PAC Fall 2009."

2001346860,242,1/11/2017,0,Great looking recipe/ vegan- no animal products including honey.
1803266070,242,10/25/2014,5,Love it !   Will make this again.
2000496795,242,9/25/2015,0,"This is the best butternut squash recipe ever, but it is even better by adding a teaspoon of allspice at the same time the half and half is added. Will make again soon!"
2001028411,242,5/28/2016,5,So easy and never fails!! I add a little more stock and I have used just pumpkin before - equally as good!
136997,242,7/17/2016,5,My husband says this is a keeper. Easy to prepare and took less than an hour.
95743,242,5/23/2004,5,"Impressive and delicious if it's not cooked until it turns grey and soggy.  Looks like a lot more work than it really is.  It's easy to put together even if it may sound a bit confusing when you read the directions.  Just follow them and it will work out beautifully.  The dressing was a bit tart for our tastes but a light sprinkle of Splenda fixed that.  This will definitely be at my next dinner party as it can easily be prepared for cooking well in advance.  Thanks, s'kat."
21752,242,3/26/2007,4,"This was actually pretty good, and I don't even like okra!  I made up for that by adding another onion to the mix, and also adding some coarse-ground Hungarian paprika.  I have to put paprika in everything.  We actually had this for breakfast, with crusty rolls, lots of sweet butter and spicy matbucha (a Middle Eastern salsa).  Thanks for the cross-cultural experience, Potts!"
171084,242,6/10/2007,5,"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this! We've fixed fried taters & onions for years but I never thought about adding okra. Served this with fried pork chops and made cream gravy from the drippings. Oh Potsie...what have you done?? :)"
2324285,242,12/11/2012,5,"This was tasty potato dish that reminded me of the potatoes my dad used to make.  He didn't use okra though, as we only just recently started getting okra in stores in Chicago.      I've gotten addicted to okra, so I think next time I might even double the amount.  I also didn't use any gravy or ketchup, as it's flavorful enough as is.  Thanks for sharing."
424680,242,6/9/2008,5,"I cut back on the amount of red pepper, but otherwise included the ingredients listed & had a very nice side dish! I particularly enjoyed it on thick slices of multigrain bread! Thanks for sharing! [Made & reviewed while on tour in Eastern Europe during the Zaar World Tour 4]"
837251,242,6/18/2008,4,"This was nice. I'm going to try it on some bread tomorrow, that seems delish to me.
The longer you leave it, the better the flavors. I followed the recipe except for the vinegar, i used balsamico. Made for the Tastebud Tickling Travellers, ZWT4"
428885,242,6/4/2007,5,"Made this for lunch, and let me tell you, if I could, I could eat this everyday. Happened to have chutney that needed using up, and had everything else on hand too. The bacon and shaved smoked salmon  coupled with the onion and cream cheese and chives just make an absolute terrific sandwich! I can see that you can also serve this on toast points and maybe the addition of cucumber too. Thanks so much English Rose! ZWT3 07'"
128473,242,5/3/2010,5,What a great sandwich.  I adored all the flavors and textures in this treat.  The mango chutney was a real nice addition.  I will be making these again often.  Thanks for sharing :)
286566,242,10/19/2013,5,"One of the best open sandwiches I have had just loved the whole lot though would like to try it toasting the bread otherwise would not make any changes whatsoever thank you English_Rose, made for Name that Ingredient tag game."
622371,242,11/8/2007,4,"Originally this recipe contained a partial list of the directions, but after reviewing my email to Diane, she revised them and I retried this...It was ""FEN""tastic!!  Thank you sooo much for aditing it...it turned out wonderful!!"
1658850,243,11/2/2010,5,"Definitely addictive! I would shrink the recipe down next time. I used the biggest bowl I had and it still wasn't big enough (I used 3 cups of each cereal). I also ended up having to add more almond bark (I used candy melt that I flavored with vanilla...and when I added the vanilla it seized the melts on the first batch). In total, I used 16 oz   12 oz of candy melts, for a total of 28 oz. More wouldn't hurt, since some of the cereal pieces didn't get coated. Still addictive! I've grabbed 2 handfuls during this review! Thanks for the recipe! I could see this becoming a tradition around here!"
2002329856,243,11/12/2018,5,"These are amazing! I was super nervous about the ratio of oatmeal and flour to wet ingredients, but they were so great! I was also scared about the recipe not having eggs, which turned out to not be a problem. I did also added: a teaspoon of vanilla extract to the cooking wet ingredients, a smidge more shortening, replumped my fried cranberries in the microwave, and replaced the 1/3 cup of flour with flax meal. It worked out great, because, flax meal seems to be a greedier dry ingredient when it comes to soaking up liquids. I love these cookies! So great! New favorite, thank you for sharing this recipe!!"
452940,243,7/10/2009,4,"Your right, we had to add quite a bit more apple juice, but it's a good cocktail that does taste a bit like apple brandy. Thanks for sharing the recipe. :)"

This is tasty, Boomie! I used exactly the ingredients as listed. YUMMO.

424680,245,8/31/2009,5,"Don't know if I changed the taste or texture of this cornbread, but I used a reduced-fat buttermilk as well as a no-sodium salt, but other than that the recipe was followed (well, I was generous with the half cup of corn!) & we had A GREAT TASTING CORNBREAD! Certainly a recipe I want to keep around ~ Thanks for sharing it! [Tagged, made & reviewed in Newest Zaar recipe tag]"
204024,246,11/26/2009,5,"An essential Thanksgiving ingredient for us.  We always make my mother's recipe for cornbread dressing.  This was a very fun and different type of cornbread.I had never used white corn, buttermilk, and actual corn in my cornbread. Also I loved making it in my cast iron skillet. It did not disappoint.
This is a much more dense and heavy  cornbread than we are used to.  Ours was a little underdone in the center so others should check carefully to make sure it is done.  Thank you for a fun experience, breezermom.  Made for Holiday PRMR."
573325,246,12/19/2009,4,"This is a dense and filling cornbread with a great crust and yummy sweetish taste!
It was very easy to put together, but in the end needed way longer to cook through for me (about 65 minutes). That might have been due to me using a bundt cake pan instead of a skillet, though.
I luved the addition of corn in this and found the white cornmeal to be an interesting change.
THANKS SO MUCH for sharing this lovely recipe with us, Breezer!"
17803,246,5/10/2010,5,"I had white cornmeal on hand so was glad to find this recipe.  I used a 10"" case iron skillet (1 3/4"" deep) to pour the batter in.  The pan was to small for all the batter, so I had a bit of a mess to clean up off the table, mostly the oil.   I could have used a cake pan but wanted to stick with the directions.  There was very little batter that baked over the pan in the oven.  It was crisp on the outside with a slightly sweet flavor.  I'll be making this again.  Made for *1 2 3 Hits  Its Not Easy Being Green  March 2010* (in May,  as I was late)"
1783373,246,5/16/2014,5,"Very nice cornbread.  So easy to make too.  Made it to accompany &quot;Recipe #495413&quot; and it was just wonderful.  This bread is good too toasted in the morning with a slather of butter over the top.  Found that the white cornflour made it light and airy.  I grew up on Portuguese cornbread which is normally made with white cornflour.  Though it is quite different from what I grew up on, I found this recipe to be airier and delightful.  Thank you breezermom for sharing."
1605636,246,4/28/2010,5,Love this recipe! I make it for my daughter as an after school snack and she loves it. It keeps her going until dinnertime.
60124,246,10/5/2012,5,"these were really good! did 2 large potatoes, (for 2) and used all the curry.<br/>They looked good, and tasted great. served with fish. made (late) for Aussie swap spet 2012"
369715,246,10/15/2013,3,This was good and easy to make. I followed the recipe as written other then I used beef broth instead of water. This was a meaty and beany chili that but it  was missing something for us.
4470,246,5/18/2004,5," This glaze is wonderful!  The meat was moist and after 35 minutes it was ready for the glaze then 10  more uncovered In fact it is so good that I am making another small batch of glaze and use it on the piece of tenderloin that I had left over.  I will slice the tenderloin into medalions, cover them with foil , heat for 10 min in 350F oven uncover and paint the medallions with the glaze. This will really saturate the flavor into the pork. Loved the flavor and the color is worth a picture.  Thanks Zenith for an easy tasty recipe"
129958,246,5/25/2004,4,"A very easy, moist and tender pork loin.  I had never cooked a pork loin before, now I am a big fan of it.  DH and I did not care for the flavor of the glaze, however it would be very easy to adjust the flavor to our personal tastes and will definitely try this again."
283251,246,3/20/2006,4,This was fabulous! I used the zest and juice of a whole orange and put it on the roast when I put it in the oven. The flavor sank into the meat. YUM! The only thing I would do differently next time is to add less allspice (I don't measure anything) because I added just a little too much.

321078,246,7/19/2008,5,"A little spicy for my daughter, but that's easily adjusted. Anything from Cook's Illustrated is always a winner! Thanks for posting.
P.S: I was a little freaked out by the clam juice, but the end result wasn't weird at all!"
1115621,246,4/23/2009,5,"My hard-to-please hubby said ""mmm-good!""  I will definitely put this dish in the permanent file. It has excellent flavor, even with the changes I made based on what was on hand: pre-cooked chicken andouille sausage, pre-cooked large shrimp, and orzo instead of rice.  Preparation was necessarily different as a result:  the (frozen, left-over) orzo was thawed in a separate pot with doses of chicken broth to keep it from sticking and turning to mush.  I cannot eat clams so I substituted chicken broth. The shrimp and sausage were put in together, closely followed by the processed vegies and remaining ingredients.  Because no rice was added I skipped the water and added only a shot of chicken broth to the jambalaya.  I served the stew over orzo rather than mixed in with it.  Rice would have been a more traditional taste but it was excellent anyway!"
911978,246,9/6/2011,5,This is a winner! Everybody loved it. The only change I made was using cilantro instead of parsley. I had some reservations about clam juice but it melted into the overall great flavor. Thanks for posting.
474322,246,6/21/2007,5,"We liked this rub a lot! It's best described as ""bright"", I think due to the lemon peel. I have added this to my list of things to make for gifts. I have used it on salmon, and on boneless chicken thighs. Thanks!"
107583,246,6/23/2007,5,"What a nice flavor this gives chicken!  I used it under the skin on a whole roast chicken.  Will try it on salmon soon!  (I used chopped fresh rosemary, since I have it growing in the yard.)"
33159,246,3/24/2008,5,"Delicious!!  I used this rub on boneless, skinless chicken breasts & then grilled.  I was a little skeptical about a 15 minute room temperature marinade but it was perfect.  Very lemony but not too much!!"
129958,246,10/14/2008,5,"Wow, I just noticed that I had not posted my review of this rub!  I apologize.  I have used it quite a bit on chicken and fish and it is always a hit.  I love simple rubs with ingredients that I keep on hand.  I can whip this up in a few moments and make simple chicken, etc taste special.  Thanks Cookin Mommy!"
1072593,246,7/14/2012,5,"I learned how to cook at my mom's side.  I was the only 3rd grader I knew who could accurately identify by smell any given herb.  Okay, I was the ONLY 3rd grader ANYBODY knew to accurately do that.  Great on chicken."

We loved this omelet,Peter!!
It was so simple to put together and I love how you can pour it in the pan and walkaway till its cooked!No fiddling, awesome!I did use green onions in place of the chives but I think your recipe can be altered to ones taste very easily.
Thanks so much for the recipe."
278118,246,12/2/2008,5,A very tasty breakfast!  I did take a picture but Lorrie's picture is MUCH better than mine.  My omelette fell apart a little when removing it from the pan I made it in.  I love this recipe as it is so versatile!  Next time I will make this in the traditional flipping over omelette style that I like so much.  Made for the December NZ/Aussie recipe swap.
133174,246,12/7/2008,5,"This reminded me more of a frittata than an omelet.  It is very easy to prepare and lends itself to many variations.  I loved that it required minimal tending to while cooking.  While writing the review, I realized that I had left off the cheese.  I do think that some Canadian bacon would be delicious with this."
329769,246,8/7/2009,5,*Reviewed for Aussie NZ Forum Recipe Swap August 2009* This was so easy to make and very filling. More like a frittata in that it contained the potato and wasn't flipped. I think mine cooked a little quicker but perhaps due to the pan size. I had worried about the potato cooking....but it was perfect. Thanks Peter- I really enjoyed the omelette. Photo also to be posted
37449,246,11/3/2009,5,my husband and I both enjoyed this yummy omelette! I did saute the potato and mushrooms before putting on top of the omelette. Thanks Peter! Made for the Australian Recipes Swap-Nov. 2009.
593927,246,3/7/2010,5,This was delicious. I did have to sub haloumi cheese for the cheddar and though they are nothing alike it was wonderful. I made this in my cast iron frying pan with a little canola oil. I will make this again with cheddar. Made for RECIPE SWAP #38 - March 2010 - Group 2 - Iced Vo Vo's.
11297,246,4/4/2010,5,"Very easy to make and no fiddling as someone else said :)  Made as listed this time but think other ingredients such as red pepper, spring onions and even ham could also be used or added.  Thanks for a such a versatile recipe. :)"
339260,246,5/10/2011,5,"Wonderful omelet recipe.  I used Egg Beaters egg substitute.  I also ""baked"" the potato in the microwave, sliced and fried it.  I sauteed the mushroom as well before topping the omelet.  I foldedthe omelet over to give it more of an omelet shape.  This omelet had the perfect combination of flavors.  I can't wait to make it again.  Made for May 2011 Aus/NZ Swap and Honor thy Mother - and be Gluten-Free, too! Tag Game."
286566,246,11/9/2011,5,"A very filling and satisfying breakfast, thank you Peter J, made for Aussie/Kiwi recipe wap, November 2011."
482376,246,12/12/2011,5,"Excellent omelette! I omitted the potato since I am doing a no-carb week. I can't wait to try it with the potato! Also, I didn't have mushrooms so I subbed in onions. I really like the method and think you could use the same method and change up the ingredients very easily. Thank you for a great breakfast! Made for the Aussie/NZ Swap and the PARTY event."
582561,246,2/4/2012,5,A delicious and substantial way to start they day.  Made for Aussie / Kiwi Swap Feb 2012.
498271,246,5/1/2012,5,"This is a hearty and tasty omelette!  Loved the potato and the fact that it was grated instead of in cubes.  Left out the chives, otherwise made as directed and really enjoyed - thanks for sharing the recipe!"
780172,246,8/23/2012,5,"This is a very good omelet, I enjoyed the addition of mushrooms and tomatoes. I like when potatoes are added to omelets, it is like a full meal then. I can not have cheese so mine was made minus cheese and it still was very nice."
128473,246,11/26/2012,5,"Frittata or Omelette by whichever name is delicious.  Quick and easy to make, filling and satisfying, great flavors and wonderful texture.  Made exactly as written, wouldn't change a thing.  Thanks so much for sharing."
239758,246,5/10/2014,5,"What a great omelet. I used a leftover baked potato, half of a largish tomato and 4 small mushrooms. The light spray of cooking oil didn&#039;t really do the job on my worn-out non-stick pan, which is why the pic looks like I had to dig the omelet out of the pan. After that I did what any upstanding Nebraska girl would do to an omelet with cheese -- I added some ketchup. Yum, yum! Thanks for posting."
403396,246,6/28/2007,5,"Very, very good!  Saved us a bit of money, too, as my son is quite fond of L&L's chicken katsu.  I made it exactly as described and put it in a styrofoam takeout box before nonchalantly tossing it on the table.  He was definitely fooled and only looked suspicious when he realized I hadn't left the house!  Thank you for this wonderful recipe!  It is definitely staying in my permanent file."
92886,246,8/9/2007,3,"Pretty good.  I found the sauce too sweet for my tastes, but if I cut back on the ketchup and sugar I think I would like it even more.  The chicken turned out nice and lightly crispy.  Made me think of schnitzel."
456455,246,11/14/2007,4,"Husband says this is a keeper! Quick, easy and tasy too."
375776,246,3/12/2009,5,"Yummy!My son,who is very picky,loved this.He loves crumbed chicken and I was very surprised when he liked the Katsu sauce.Will be making this again,thank you!Additional note,I have found it's easy to freeze in ice cube trays and then transfer them to a container."
1327837,246,2/18/2010,5,made this for my wife and what a treat. i am a truck driver and stumbled across l.l. close to one of my stops was very pleased with the texture and taste told my wife she needs to taste this chicken stuff i had found started looking aroundand found this what a great recipe if nbot as good as L.L. better all my kids now hve it in there favorite box iron woman i woulk hiss you for this thanks    papa bob
1568184,246,3/3/2010,5,I love this recipe!  Its really easy to make and the Panko makes the chicken taste so crunchy and crispy!  Goes great paired with Hawaiian Macaroni Salad
349461,246,1/24/2011,5,"I made this recipe in Wisconsin on a day that the temperature outside was in the single digits, and it brought back memories of eating 'plate lunch' on Oahu when I was in the Navy. I loved this recipe, and it tasted just like I remember. I didn't have any chicken breasts, but I used pork instead, and it was delicious."
1024930,246,6/18/2011,5,"Ok, so this recipe (for me) get the 5 stars JUST for the sauce. We had L&L for dinner the other day, and my boyfried who is NOTORIOUSLY BAD at screwing up directions, orderd REGULAR portions for me AND my 6 yr old daughter, and only got 1 thing of sauce!!!  needless to say, my daughter and i could have SPLIT just ONE of the generouse portions and had leftovers... so I had A LOT of leftovers!  BUT NO SUACE!!!  i googled ' L&L Katsu sauce recipe""  and this came up. I made it, and its tastes pretty much SPOT ON to L&L!!!!  major props!!!"
1975031,246,8/8/2011,5,AWESOME. Trying brown sugar instead of granulated next time to see if it makes a difference in taste. This recipe is right on the money though! Try it!
2780901,246,4/17/2013,5,Awesome recipe.  Made it for dinner and everyone loved it.
921361,246,10/3/2014,0,Tasted great and was super easy to make. Thanks for the recipe!
2001039822,246,6/6/2016,5,"Very simple recipe, easy to follow. Only trouble I had was the process of making the sauce. Other than that everything was perfect! I also went and used macaroni salad as a side!"
2001615771,246,7/6/2017,5,"Thanks so much for this recipe! My son and I have been going to Hawaii for last few years but not this year. He's addicted to L&amp;L Hawaiian BBQ's Chicken Katsu. We're from Michigan and don't have them here. Went out West this year and he managed to find an L&amp;L in Portland, OR, 30 miles out of our way in 100&deg; heat. Made this tonight and he was over the moon! Used organic chicken breasts, pounced down and soaked in buttermilk to tenderize. The guy from the Portland L&amp;L mentioned using a 1/2 brown/white sugar mixture, which kept sauce from being too sweet. Only issue I had was some of the coating was coming off on last batch. I used jumbo eggs, which is what I had on hand, so batter was a little thin. Served with scoop of jasmine rice and Mac salad I had leftover from 4th of July party."
160974,246,10/3/2007,5,"I couldn't resist even though it is fall! I was able to find pretty good nectarines so it was fine. This is so intensely fruity and refreshing. I love the fresh fruit chunks. Delicious with/without Cool Whip. I used four dessert glasses and the rest fit (to the top) of a 9 inch square pan. Thanks Tammi, for another great recipe.

1024982,246,4/22/2009,5,Sounds like the real thing!
2001454217,246,7/12/2018,4,Salad was awesome. I also added parsley for freshness. great meal added to my nutrition plan.
200862,246,3/2/2011,3,"MADE FOR PAC, March 2011. Dear AskCy, this recipe is very hard for me to review. As my adopted cook, I'd love to give you 5 stars for every recipe!! This one made it to ""good"" (3 stars). It is perfectly nice, very easy, real comfort food, but the taste is very ordinary. Normally I would have added lots of herbs and maybe chillies, but I wanted us to taste your recipe as you wrote it. AskCy, maybe my biggest problem is with your cooking method, and I wonder if you'd consider editing your recipe? The litre of beef stock would have been FAR too much: I added 1 cup! (250 ml). (Did you make a mistake with that litre?) In the photos you can hopefully see 250 ml was enough, as the veggies also shed some liquid. I also have a problem with your cooking times. No ways could I cook this dish, after adding the peas, ""for a good hour""!! I added the peas once the baby potatoes was almost tender, and it took literally minutes for the peas and potatoes to be perfect after that, and I removed it from the heat. A small point, but maybe worth mentioning for the 5-star recipes you are still going to post for us: list your ingredients in the order in which they will be used, i.e. oil first. The title: it puzzled me a little (this is not a criticism!) as we would never call a mince dish a ""stew"". One associates a stew with chunks of meat. But never mind that. Also, this dish, with rice and sides, will feed at least 4 - 6 hungry people! Very economical in these times. Thank you, AskCy, and please post more of your recipes!"
166642,246,11/10/2007,5,"These are outstanding! We just loved them - great flavor and easy to make! I did serve them with chicken, just not barbecue, but they were delicious. No leftovers! Thanks!"
430471,246,12/10/2007,5,So good and easy the only thing I thought was missing was some cheese. Maybe next time I'll add some. Served with chilli. YUMMY!
527607,246,2/2/2008,5,"Outstanding.  I was non traditional and served them with sour cream (low fat) lol

easy and delicious, a great lunch"
337963,246,4/28/2008,4,"What a fun recipe!  I served them with sticky fingers and a tomato salad.  We weren't quite sure how to serve them, so I topped mine with sour cream and more green onion, and for hubby I served drizzled with a bit of molasses instead.  The best thing about this recipe is that you can serve a ""bread"" side with dinner that's made from scratch and is super quick.  Thanks for posting Paula, made for PAC.  Please see my rating system as I rate tougher than most."
837152,246,5/15/2008,5,Had along with fried chicken and we woofed them down in no time!  We put butter on ours.
128473,246,4/19/2010,5,"Another tasty treat from Paula.  Wow, were these good.  I had never tried them before, so wasn't sure what to expect.  A lovely light tasting pancake with an awesome flavor.  These were incredible served plain with recipe #283235 and steamed rice.  They really were excellent, they sopped up the tasty gravy beautifully, even my picky dh had two.  Into my keeper box this goes, can't wait to try it with BBQ chicken and crispy pork.  Thank you so much for sharing.  Made for Pac 2010 :)"
174096,246,4/25/2010,5,"Delicious!  We loved how it got a nice crispy outside, with a good flavor, and a light texture.  I drizzled ours with honey just before serving.  It made a great brunch with Recipe #310625.  Thanks for sharing!"
339260,246,2/18/2011,5,"I think this makes a delicious side to almost any meal.  These hoecakes were easy to whip up and cook on the griddle.  They were light and delicious.  I ate some with just butter and some with honey...both were yummy!  The green onion was a nice touch.  I think they would be really good with some green chiles also.  Thanks for another great recipe, PaulaG.  Made for Best of 2010 Cookbooks Tag Game."
1531249,246,7/20/2012,4,"These tasted delicious.  However, I had some difficulty flipping them because they were so fragile.  I finally switched from my cast iron skillet to a nonstick pan, with better results."
781390,246,4/22/2008,5,"Very good, followed recipe and turned out delicious."
39334,246,2/10/2008,5,"These were so good!!! We planned on making bone-in breasts, but after realizing all I had was boneless breasts, I decided to use this recipe. And I am so glad I did! The only thing I did differently was to put the chicken on a rack on a cookie sheet to keep the bottoms from getting soggy. But the cornflakes made for a crispy coating and the seasoning was delicious!!! Thanks for posting such a yummy, delicious recipe...I can't wait to try it with tenders for chicken strips...yum!"
610843,246,1/10/2008,5,"My mom found this recipe in a magazine many years ago and it was passed on to me when I got married. This is one of my families most favorite meals. I usually don't have olives but the taste is still great. I have also used Jiffy corn muffin mix for the crust. It is a sweeter crust than I prefer, but makes this recipe a quick fix dinner. Fat-free refried beans help cut down on calories and does not affect the taste. I also use turkey burger instead of ground beef."
36128,246,1/7/2003,5,"I am so grateful for this recipe.  It is hard getting my family to love eggplant as I do, so I wanted to try this one, cuz it sounded so yummy!  This was an over all winner with everyone here.  My son loved it, and my hubby too!  I think he went backe for 4ths.  LOL  I made it with shredded mozza since I didnt have a block of cheese to cut!  THanks for a great side dish!!!"
59064,246,1/24/2003,5,"Yum! something this quick should not taste so good and be so healthy. Even people who don't like tofu should like this one and it is a great way of using nutritional yeast.
I made a few minor changes using grapeseed oil, ketjap manis, lime juice and wholegrain mustard because that's what I had in the house. It's a great recipe for those days when you don't want to cook at all and want something light but substantial."
46545,247,2/26/2003,5,"Wonderful sauce for pasta, veggies, rice, maybe even a baked potato!  I used 1/2 C water and dissolved 1 large veg bouillon cube in it for the vegetable stock.  This gives it even more flavor.  Also, I used a little less oil to save a few fat calories.   "
140331,249,4/7/2005,5,Where has this recipe been all my life?  It's too good to pass up.  I had it on noodles and then again on rice and then again over rice and veggies.  Love it.Thanks!
277855,249,12/27/2005,5,"I loved this and so did the non-vegetarians I served it to.
"
163214,249,4/13/2006,5,My whole family loved this sauce. I heated it and served it over rotini pasta. I will definitely make this again. Thanks! 
91724,249,8/11/2007,5,"This is so good and it's good on so many things, as others have mentioned. I heated it and served it over angel hair pasta and vegetables and it's the kind of thing you can't stop eating. My one year old grandson loved it.  Doesn't matter if you don't like tofu; it doesn't taste like tofu."
85730,249,2/10/2011,5,"This was different from other pasta sauces I've had or made, but it was tasty. No one will know there's tofu in it unless you tell them, and it's got a whole lot more protein than your average pasta sauce. We enjoyed it over Barilla Plus penne and steamed broccoli."
68460,249,3/22/2003,5,"Another good recipe!  I made this exactly as written using 1 pound of white button mushrooms and 1/2 pound baby portobellos.  This soup has a rich, earthy flavor and smells wonderful while it's cooking.  It was the perfect meal for us on the cold, rainy day we were having.  I served it with Caesar salad and hot rolls.  Perfect!  Thanks for the recipe, it's going into my permanent recipe file!"
65056,249,11/20/2003,5,"I made this as part of the Comfort Food Cook-a-thon and I'm so glad I did!  My boyfriend decided this is his new favorite soup (and I make a lot of soups) and ate a bowl of it with breakfast, lunch and dinner until it was gone.  I made it a week (or more) ago and he's been bothering me every day to make more!  I dodn't have any bay leaves, so I used some thyme and other spices to taste.  I used a mix of white button and crimini (these are the same thing as baby portobello, by the way, for those who don't know).  I also used one small-medium unpeeled russet potato.  Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful.  This tastes completely gormet and really isn't much work, less slicing all the mushrooms.  I know I'll be making this again (by BF demands it!)  Thanks so much for posting."
80353,251,1/3/2004,5,"Truly delicious and so easy to make!  I used a combination of button mushrooms and oyster mushrooms (no portobella here today) and the flavour was outstanding.  Soothing, satisfying, and the barley added just the right touch of toothsomeness.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe that goes in the keeper file!"
123640,251,3/7/2004,5,"This recipe was very well received at our house.  I thought it was a good, tasty soup, but my husband and a visiting friend practically inhaled it, and hubby has been demanding it ever since.  I made the recipe as-is the first time, and added 1/2 tsp thyme after that."
116315,252,5/21/2004,5,"Like the other reviews, a very good soup, it smelt so delicious and was too.  I added about 2 tbsp. of sour cream to each bowl full and this was what I was missing in my personal taste."
37779,252,12/20/2004,5,This is a very soul-soothing delicious soup. We are just starting to get bitter cold weather here and I am so glad I had this soup to enjoy. I used a combo of baby bellas and button mushrooms. I made no alterations and the flavor and smell were excellent. Thanks for sharing this recipe. Will make again.
246898,256,10/2/2005,5,My mother says this is the best mushroom barley soup she has ever had. I put some in the freezer to save and she took it back out to serve to company. I added some additional barley and I simmered the soup for an hour. Will be making this often.
108902,256,10/30/2005,5,"Wow. This is sooo amazing. It took me a little longer than I expected with all the chopping of vegetables, but it was worth it. I didn't have barley, so I used Instant Brown Rice. I'll be making this often. Thanks!"
223325,261,11/3/2005,4,"A very tasty and enjoyable dish, but I think you might consider it more of a stew than a soup. Either way it was delicious!!"
278207,261,1/1/2006,5,"This soup reminded me of the traditional mushroom soup my family made every Christmas Eve, only with more butter and minus the carrots and potato.  It took me forever to cut up all the veggies because I'm not a good cook.  Regardless, this soup turned out delicious.  I still can't believe I made something so good."
39835,261,2/13/2006,4,Very good soup which we enjoyed with popoovers. Instead of the chicken broth I used half chicken broth and half vegetable broth--next time I think I'll use all vegetable broth to make it a vegetarian soup. Thanks for sharing!
62043,261,10/10/2006,5,"This was an extremely delicious barley soup. The addition of portobella mushrooms added a meaty, woodsy taste that was very appealing. I will definately make this again. Thanks!"
362983,261,1/2/2007,4,"Great soup. Very easy to make and it was hearty and delicious. I added lots of herbs to the soup, though I would probably add some seasonings when sauteeing the vegetables to add some more flavour to them in the soup since they seemed a little bland to me with just butter. Still, very yummy!"
208125,261,11/1/2007,5,"Very delicious, the mushroom flavour wasn't drowned out by the other ingredients. I followed the recipe exactly and we thought that it didn't really need the potato but the soup would be great either way."
203111,261,11/4/2007,3,"This is one of those soups that shouldn't be served until the next day, IMO.  It was ok the first day but I had my doubts about making it again because it takes so long to cut up all the vegs.  But I decided it was all well worth it when I had a bowl the next day. Yum! I did add about 1/4 cup of cream to it."
149075,261,5/20/2009,5,"a lovely, nourishing soup. I only used half the butter, and just a little oil to saute the veggies. I added a touch of sherry towards the end to enhance the nutty flavor of  the different mushrooms I used. The family loved this soup."
206213,261,6/24/2009,4,"I made this soup yesterday, with adjusted menu for 4 people - DH dislikes too much barley :>( doesn't know what's good for him!
I have to say I wasn't overly impressed with the initial flavour, so added some good frozen(then defrosted) chicken stock to it. Today I reheated it and felt the flavour had much improved. I really enjoyed it -- DH said- less barley and more potato -- I disagree as I love barley. I don't know that it will be a regular on  our soup menu, but I'll will have it again - for me!!! Thank you BoxO'Wine because I love soup and it's always  good to have a go at something different from the norm :>)"
234075,261,1/3/2010,5,"Very good. I used olive oil instead of butter, and added about a tsp dried thyme, little bit of rosemary, and finished it with a generous dollop of chardonnay. The next day, the flavor had become rich and full bodied. Thanks for posting. I will make this again!"
545970,261,1/23/2011,3,"I liked this and it was better the 2nd day.  I'm only giving 3 stars because no one else in the family would eat it, even the mushroom lovers.  If I were to make this again, I would chop all the mushrooms (instead of the slicing) and double the barley."
744367,261,1/25/2011,0,"This soup was delicious. i only made a couple changes.  I used one can of beef broth, one can of chicken broth and 2 cans of vegetable broth. I also used salted butter since thats what i had on hand. I sliced some shitake and baby portebellos too to add to the mix, they were a delicious addition.  I am giving it 5 stars and would give it more if i could because it was my 11 and 7 year old that ate ALL of the soup!  I had a bowl before i napped before my 3rd shift job, and when i awoke, looking forward to bringing a bowl to work with me, it was GONE!!  DH told me that they each had 2 helpings for dinner, and the kids begged for more later till they finished it!  Needless to say, im on my way to the store after writing this review, to get some more mushrooms to make a double recipe for tonights dinner :)  oh, let me add that i also left out the potato"
1991003,261,4/5/2012,5,I have put this soup into my new healthy menu rotation.  It is delicious.  I used beef broth cubes and cut the amount by 50% to help reduce the sodium level.  Thank you for sharing this healthful recipe!
53156,261,3/21/2003,5,"This cake was easy and really yummy! I do a lot of ""high end"" baking normally. Genoise, etc. But this time I needed a quick cake and this fits the bill. Wonderfully moist and flavorful."
50711,261,6/4/2006,3,"My DH is a chocoholic so this recipe sounded right up his alley.  While it was very easy to make, and it was moist and tasted ok, I didn't think it had much chocolate flavor.  If I make again I will add more melted chocolate and see if that helps.  Thanks for posting this Elaine."
198154,262,7/16/2014,5,"I&#039;m typically not a fan of the texture of buttermilk cakes. But I had buttermilk that I needed to use up and I needed to make a cake for my in laws anniversary.  The other thing that made me a little hesitant was the nutmeg. A lot of recipes add cinnamon to their chocolate cake and I don&#039;t care for it.  This cake however, had good texture and great flavor! The only thing I would suggest is to check your cake. Mine was finished with more than five minutes left on the timer.   I topped this with a chocolate fudge buttercream frosting. Yum!"
55380,266,7/5/2004,4,"Thanks, Shelly! The fridge died and I was left with all the meat thawed, including a brisket, and none of the condiments I usually use. This saved the brisket! I've never used Liquid Smoke for this cut before, although I had some in the cabinet for summer sausage. I'd wondered when it made such a small amount but trusted your note in the recipe and you're right! I ended up marinading it for almost 24 hrs and then cooked it in the crockpot. It was very flavorful - tangy and smoky - and I have a feeling the leftovers would have been even moreso...if there had been any! ;o) I'm not sure it will replace our main recipe, but we now have the perfect backup. A definite 4.5 stars!"
6357,266,9/1/2004,5,This was incredibly truly so yummy that my dad has requested me to make it every alternate weekend for dessert!! Truly a keeper:) Thank you very much for sharing! 
141042,266,9/7/2004,5,"Just delicious fudgy fudge.  This was enjoyed by young and old alike.  I added chopped nuts and an additional drop of orange extract, as my grated orange zest fell a little short of the two teaspoons the recipe calls for.  I'm going to try the mint too!  Thank you for posting!"
130970,266,11/21/2004,5,"This recipe is so simple and good. I made 2 batches today, one with orange zest and Cointreau, the other one with Chambord, and instead of pecan (the only kind of nut I don't like too much), I added chopped walnut and almond. Turns out very well. This will definitely be one item in my xmas gifts."
98063,266,2/18/2005,5,"I've made this about five times already and keep forgetting to review it. It is yummy and beautifully simple to make. I never used the pecans, but did add a tsp of orange extract. I'll have to try the other variations some time, but I just keep making this one because it is so good."
138861,266,3/19/2005,5,"YUM!!! This was so good that we ate almost the whole batch in one night. I did have a bit of trouble initially trying to get the chocolate and condensed milk to melt and smoothen but I think it was because I had the double boiler on too high of a temperature. Oh well, the taste was still the best, and it was so simple to put it together. I will definately be making this again."
206722,270,6/3/2005,5,"This was wonderful, and SO easy to make. It came out beautifully....put a smile on all our faces!"
39194,270,12/26/2005,5,"I was very glad I tried this fudge!  It was quite easy to make, and although I did use orange extract (3 drops), it came out wonderful.  I am going to experiment with other flavors as well.  Thank you Marg! :)"
55380,270,12/27/2005,5,"This was simple enough that my 10 yr old could do it on her own, but definitely good enough to give for gifts. The first time we used grated orange peel (the kind in a jar in the spice aisle) and the orange flavor was barely discernable. The next time we tried fresh orange zest and it was better. I have some orange extract and we'll try adding a dash of that next time, since we're all huge chocolate-orange fiends and like the stronger flavor combo. Orange taste or not, this is a simple but very good fudge, very smooth and not overly sweet (we used a combination of semi-sweet and milk chocolate chips). We haven't tried the pecans yet but I'm sure one of these times we'll toss them in as well. Thanks so much for posting! "
280238,270,1/2/2006,5,"I made two different fudge recipes for Christmas this year.  The first go-round  the fudge was made from scratch and was tedious to make. My family loved it and It turned out nice and creamy.  Then I made this recipe.  Wow..my family LOVED it and our friends begged for more. They raved about how the fudge just melted in your mouth with rich chocolaty flavor - then the orange kicked in! Sort of a one-two punch of tasty delight! I made lots of it for Christmas gifts and I cut it into big hunks, wrapped it in plastic wrap, put a beautiful ribbon around it and included a clear plastic knife for cutting off your own pieces.  It was fudge to be proud of.  From now on, this is the fudge I'll be making for gift giving.  Quick and easy. What could be better?  Oh yeah...don't forget the walnuts!  Yum!  Thanks Marg for submitting this wonderful recipe."
14112,270,1/4/2006,5,"This fudge is delicious!  I have never made fudge before.  I've always been too scared to try.  This seemed easy enough, and it was!  I will definitely make this again.  Thank you for a great recipe."
102058,270,2/1/2006,5,"I made this without the nuts too... Wonderful ! Smooth, and deceptive... it sets very solid, so I was a bit worried, but cuts easily with a decent amount of pressure (I didn't break my hand doing it) and it was still melt in your mouth soft once you took a piece or ..um... 4 !!! Our family aren't fans of orange peel so I used two teaspoons of orange essence... could have been a bit stronger for our taste at least 'cos the orange was only a vague after-taste of orange instead of a more predominant flavour (which DH really likes) I'm itching to make this with the peppermint in it and might even try a mix with some Tia Maria one time or Bailies ?... this will be my recipe of choice when DD's school asks for bake sale things for fundraising since it's just embarrasingly easy and fast to make and you just know that kids will leave telling you that they need something until the evening before... Now, no stress, I will have this recipe on hand to whip up and save the day :) Please see my rating system, an excellently deserved 5 stars! Thanks !
UPDATE: I've made this 4 times recently and I added 3 Tablespoons of peppermint essence to get the strength that's perfect for us. Mint is the prefered flavour here so far... this stuff practically walks off the plate when you have guests, so I'll be making this often in the future. Thanks !"
202661,270,2/2/2006,5,"My fudge of choice.  I have made this recipe dozens of times over the past ten years.  Everyone is correct that it disappears.  I bring the ingredients to work and and make in my microwave I have there.  It amazes everyone to see it made.  For gifts I cut it into squares and roll those into truffle balls then roll in or sprinkle with cocoa powder.  It makes a very elegant gift that way. I use 3 - 4 drops of Orange Oil by Nature's Flavors when I am making orange fudge, but Nature's Flavors has so many wonderful oil concentrates the possibilities are endless.  Please try this fudge.  You'll never make another."
234222,270,2/2/2006,5,Wow - this fudge is wonderful!  What could be better than an easy recipe with great results?!  I used pure orange extract instead of the orange zest and it turned out great!  Thanks for sharing - will make again!
144431,271,4/25/2006,5,"Wonderful and so easy!  I halved the recipe, but used the full amount of orange zest and added about 1 teaspoon of Triple Sec.  After chilling, I rolled into truffles and then in cocoa powder.  Served on a bed of mini chocolate chips and long, thin orange zest shavings, they were a hit!  I can't wait to try them with other flavors; thank you!"
303646,271,5/9/2006,5,I wouldn't really describe the end product of this recipe as fudge but everyone who tried it couldn't get enough of it. My friend won't let me make anymore bcos she's addicted to these and i'm spoiling her diet; Lol! I hadn't got any pecans so i omitted them and added 1/2 teaspoon of chilli powder (sounds weird but it honestly tastes good). Thanks for this fabulous recipe!
213540,271,9/29/2006,5,Awesome and soooooo easy! My 6 and 8 year old boys love to help make this and eat it too:) So far we like the peppermint extract the best. Four drops gave it a subtle peppermint flavor and 7 drops gave it a little more distinct flavor. Thanks for the great recipe!
198059,271,10/22/2006,5,This is so delicious it's going to be my xmas gift of choice. 
361186,271,10/27/2006,4,This was so quick and easy and the texture is perfect - so smooth. It cuts beautifully too. I just have to work on getting the flavor to how I like it. I think the idea of half milk-chocolate half semi-sweet is a good one. I tried peppermint instead of the orange flavor so that might have been part of the problem. The dark chocolate might have been a better compliment to the orange flavor.
751189,271,4/2/2009,5,Love this!!
158087,271,10/29/2006,5,It's amazing what a few ingredients can produce.  I used 2 c bittersweet and 1/2 c semi-sweet and skipped the pecans.  I will use this recipe from now on.  Thanks!
152393,271,12/2/2006,4,"This is an easy, delicious recipe.  I had 3 cups of chocolate chips left so I  microwaved those with low-fat condensed milk at 30 second intervals until melted, then added 3 teaspoons of orange extract with the rest of the ingredients   After pouring into a pan, I grated a little extra orange peel on top.  This is a very good recipe for anyone that enjoys the taste of chocolate and orange together it makes a perfect addition to my holiday gift baskets!  Thanks Marg for this great recipe."
248414,271,12/23/2006,5,This is a real star of a recipe! Incredibly easy and everyone loves it!  I also made it without the nuts and grated extra  orange zest on top.
473347,271,4/30/2007,5,"This was my first try at making fudge and it couldn't have been easier. I used the microwave and added 2 teaspoons orange extract. I omitted the pecans, this is a keeper!"
106867,271,5/18/2007,3,"This was good, but the texture is different than typical fudge.  This is absolutely smooth, without the grainyness I associate with fudge.  I left out the orange zest and just left it chocolate and nuts. Next time I will use a blend of milk and dark chocolate."
110433,271,11/2/2007,5,"This is amazing! I brought half a batch in to work yesterday, and it was gone in minutes! I brought the other half today and it disappeared! My mother, who is very picky, loved it, and I'm making two batches for a friend's sweet trays for their wedding. I used orange flavour instead of zest. I'm going to try Cointreau in the next batch. Our cans are 12oz, so I used 2 cups and a handfull of chips and it worked beautifully. Melted in a glass measuring cup in the microwave. Thanks!

Update:  I just made a batch of these with zest, and the orange flavour really comes through.  I'm finding the two cups and a handfull too little though.  I'm going to bring it up to 2 1/2 cups of chips with our 10oz can so they don't get so soft if you leave them out for a bit.  Still taste amazing."
395940,271,11/18/2007,3,"Creamy, but way too sweet. Easy one to make!"
360471,272,11/25/2007,5,"I absolutely love how easy this is to make and it's really creamy and rich. I'm not crazy about orange and chocolate so I substituted about 3tsp of Peppermint extract (I say ""about"" because I was making a double batch and 6 tsp was almost the whole bottle of extract so I just dumped the rest in :) )Then I topped it with crushed peppermint pieces and OH MY GOSH!!! it was so good. I had to keep hubby and daughter off of it since I was making it as gifts..I let them have SOME, I'm not that mean. I was trying this out because I was wanting something that was easy but looked impressive and tatsed great to make for teachers and I definitely found it! This is going in my permanent file."
381180,272,12/5/2007,5,Quick and easy ~ and delicious!  I made a 2-layer chocolate and peanut butter fudge ~ pairing this fudge (used 1 tsp vanila extract instead of the orange zest) with Recipe #115656.
506722,272,12/8/2007,5,"Just made this plain for a first run.  Creamy, and yummy.  So easy.  Next time I'll add nuts, and will like it even better.  Thank you, I told Mom I'd do fudge for Dad because she just had surgery.  With a baby it was going to have to happen after he was in bed.  This was so easy, I made it while he played on the floor.  He saw the chocolate chips and started to scream (Mom gave him one last time we stopped by when I was doing laundry).  He likes fudge now, too.  Lucky for him I make it whenever Dad needs a fix, and at Christmas, but not weekly.  This was so easy it could be made weekly, but then I would really gain weight.:)"
231054,273,12/10/2007,5,"What could possibly be easier -- and yet be so dang delicious???  I only add to what others have said -- what an easy fudge recipe -- and yes it DOES have feet because it truly can ""walk off the plate"".  I used the grated orange zest and added a couple drops of orange extract.  Peppermint is next!!!!  Thanks Marg for sharing this recipe with all of us."
209154,273,12/13/2007,5,"A truly decadent fudge.  This fudge held its shape nicely and had a nice, smooth texture (not gritty).  LOVE the orange.  It made it taste similar to orange sticks.  Yummie!!!  I made three different fudges (#4075 & #68659) and this was my favoriate by far.  Thanks, Marg."
189616,274,12/14/2007,5,"With how much my family enjoyed this fudge, I wish I actually had a sweet tooth. They raved over this. Was planning on orange, but everyone wanted me to make peppermint.
Super recipe!"
469903,275,12/17/2007,5,"Perfect, easy orange fudge!!  I skipped the nuts and the fudge was smooth and creamy, just wonderful. I chilled in the fridge for about an hour and then easily cut into bite-size pieces and returned them to the fridge for safe keeping - they turned out beautifully. The only trouble will be keeping them around long enough to share for Christmas... can't keep anyone out of them! Really great recipe, I plan to make the peppermint too!"
451042,276,12/21/2007,5,"This is the perfect, dark chocolately rich, dense fudge and orange combo. If you really want the orange to give a punch, I suggest adding 3 teaspoons of orange zest. Make sure your orange zest comes from an orange with thick, ripe skin.

I have been making this recipe for 3 years now and found that I have to melt the chocolate chips first and then add the milk. Otherwise it gets too thick and I cannot mix it.

My husband melted the chips and I added the milk and orange peel. 

We had to work quickly once the milk went in because it does thicken. We spread it in a baking dish lined with parchment paper and let it chill for 2 hours before cutting. I love the truffles idea and am going to attempt to do that with our next batch. Thanks!"
739521,276,12/30/2009,5,Great Recipe!  Gave as gifts to several people who raved about it!  Can't believe how quick and easy this recipe was.  Thanks for posting!
226066,276,12/22/2007,5,"36 people can't be wrong!!! :) Made this without the pecans and brought to the office for the last day of work before Christmas... these were gone within minutes!! (Glad I kept a few at home!! ;) - this is easy, sweet and oh so good!!  Thanks Marg for a fudge recipe that I will be making again and again!! :)"
537188,276,12/25/2007,3,"Strangely enough, this fudge hasn't set. It does taste quite nice though but there's no way I would be able take it out of the tin - I think we're going to have to resort to eating it with spoons!"
548802,276,12/27/2007,5,I really liked the simplicity of this recipe. I doubled it and made half peppermint (4teas peppermint extract) and half with pecans. I never added any orange flavoring. It adapted well. This was a big hit at Christmas!
479694,276,1/2/2008,5,I used peppermint versus the orange.  It turned out very well especially me being the novice baker.  I could even  make it. I took it to a potluck and people raved. Next time I will use a little less peppermint then suggested in another review.  It came out a little strong
614212,277,1/7/2008,5,"VERY easy, and turned out soooo well. It's delicious. DH loves it. I made it with mint this time, but I can't wait to try it with orange, that's what we really want....and then every other possible flavour :) this is the first time I've sucessfully made fudge, and I am so happy I tried this recipe. Oh, I left out the pecans as well."
242444,278,1/8/2008,5,"So easy and yummy.  The first time I made it I used 1 bag of chocolate chips.  It was good, but not as good as when I made it again and used the full 2 1/2 cups. I also omitted the nuts.  

I have also melted the chocolate and condensed milk together then split the batch in half and made half peppermint and half orange.  It's good both ways."
354628,278,2/3/2008,5,"This is great. This is actually the one thing my brother in law requested I make as soon as he returned from Iraq.
I also top it with an orange glaze.  I mix powdered sugar, and milk, with food coloring and orange extract. It makes it colorful, and adds a little something extra."
544026,278,2/19/2008,4,"I made this for a chocolate party at work and both DH and I liked them (I made both the orange and the peppermint variety). I used zest from freshly picked oranges, yet we barely could detect the orange flavor. I used a 1/2 teaspoon of peppermint extract, and also had difficulty in identifying the flavor....so I added another 1/2 tsp. It seemed to work better. With the orange zest, I added chopped pecans, and nothing to the peppermint variety. We both liked the orange flavor better, albeit faint. It may be the nuts that drew us to that decision. All in all, it was a very good recipe, but not out of this world. This is an easy recipe to follow and to make. Thanks for posting, Marg."
13483,278,4/27/2008,5,Just a very easy yet excellent fudge to make.  I used the pepermint extract  (about a teaspoon) and it was great.  Love easy and good stuff like this.  Thanks for the post.
774187,278,6/28/2008,5,"WONDERFUL fudge! What a wonderful marriage of flavors! I did add an extra teaspoon of freshly grated zest, left out the nuts and used milk chocolate chips rather than the semi sweet. Made it for a dinner party, and it was a HUGE hit! I would recommend refrigerating over night or at least eight hours. I did mine for four and they were still slightly gooey. But still scrumptious! And the flavor of the orage did seem to come out more the next day. I don't know why. But Yummy!"
97780,278,12/14/2008,3,This gets credit for being easy but just didn't do much for me.  Maybe using milk chocolate chips would have made it better.  I hoped the sweet milk would sweeten up the chocolate but it really didn't and then the orange seemed to make the judge bitter.  I love orange chocolate but I won't be making this again.
944660,278,12/16/2008,1,"WORST fudge recipe I have ever had the misfortune of making! It gets one star from me because it apparently worked for other people. This garbage did not set properly, even after over 15 hours. Do NOT make this recipe unless you are willing to risk the colossal waste of time and money."
1055399,278,12/23/2008,5,"I LOVE this fudge recipe!! It is very versatile. I made it once with only the choc. chips, condensed milk and 1/2 tsp of orange extract, once with the choc. chips, cond. milk, and 1/2 tsp of peppermint extract and crushed candycane on top, and once with choc. chips, cond. milk, and walnuts. I used Nestle choc. chips and Borden Sweetened Condensed Milk and it set perfectly. It was solid, yet creamy. What an easy, yet delicious recipe!!!!"
297303,278,2/23/2009,3,"although, this candy had a great orange flavor, we didn't care for this.  It's not what I consider fudge. My husband thought it was more on the chewy side.  I also don't care to keep my fudges refrigerated.  When I took it out of the refrigerator, the chocolate melted on our fingers.  Sorry, I was really hoping to love this, seeing how it is so easy."
384088,278,3/30/2009,5,I made this for the holidays and it was a big hit! This has now been added to my regular baking goodies. :-)
274467,278,12/18/2009,5,"Fantastic!  Super easy, too.  I used 2 tsp. orange extract instead of the orange zest, and it was perfect.  I made one batch without nuts and used chopped walnuts for the other, since it was what I had on hand.  Today, I am going to try and make a mint variation.  Thanks for the recipe, Marg!"
228229,278,12/19/2009,5,"Very, very, very good!"
592157,278,8/19/2008,5,This was really very good.  I did cut back on the chilies (family preference) but it still had so much flavor.
87236,278,1/3/2010,5,"Incredible!!!  So many people raved about this fudge (which I have made twice in a week already!) and I felt a twinge of guilt about the fact that it only took about five minutes to prepare, from start to finish!!!  I have made fudge in the past which entailed a lot of time and fuss, and all I can say is that nothing compared to the ease, simplicity and taste of this recipe! Instead of using orange zest, I used 1 1/2 tsp of orange extract, and it tasted just like Chocolate Orange confectionery that can be bought in the candy section of grocery stores! (but softer)!  I placed the condensed milk and Chocolate chips in a bowl, mixed it together, then nuked it in the microwave at power level 7 for three minutes. After mixing it with a wooden spoon until it was smooth and blended, I added the extract. So easy!  This recipe will readily lend itself to experimentation. (and I WILL be experimenting!)  Maybe next time I'll use white chocolate chips with almond extract, or maybe peanut butter chips! Thank you so much for posting, Marg!"
880245,278,5/30/2010,5,"This is superb. I changed it up by using  dark chocolate,1/4 c pecans and 1/4 c chopped dried cranberries num num
kpb"
688566,279,6/3/2010,5,"Fantastic, whipped this up this morning before work.  Made in microwave as per another reviewers suggestion 3 minutes on 70% power.  Didn't even stir during this time.  Mixed together beautifully.  I used about a cup each of milk and dark chocolate and half a cup on peppermint chocolate & about 1/2 tsp peppermint essence.  Its in the fridge chilling now & the whole process took only 5 minutes.  From the taste on the spoon this is going to be great.  Is supposed to be a gift for this afternoon, hope it makes it there!"
307475,280,12/1/2010,0,"These are great for someone like me who can't have gluten! I used the peppermint extract, and they flew off the plate at a party I hosted.<br/><br/>My only thought, and this sounds a little silly perhaps: be sure you are using sweetened condensed milk and not evaporated milk, as the latter would yield terrible, wet results."
1144471,280,12/18/2010,4,"I made this just as directed and I LOVED the flavor. Not sure I am 100% fan of the consistancy...I like my fudge a little more firm. But, have decided to make another batch and cook it a little longer to see if that makes a difference."
344199,280,12/19/2010,5,This fudge tastes like a Cadbury Chocolate orange!  I added a tsp vanilla extract and 1/2 tsp orange extract and 2 Tablespoons of butter.  Delicious!
938397,280,12/5/2011,4,I really enjoyed this fudge.  Simple. Easy.  Quick.  I used dark chocolate and walnuts. I rate 4 stars as a recipe that I would do again and share with others.  5 stars is something I'm dying to make again and add to my home cookbook.  The only reason I didn't do 5 stars is becuase I like the texture of Mackinaw Island fudge the most (which the make on cooled granite stone).  Thanks for sharing!
875884,280,12/16/2011,5,"wow, so good and so easy!  I found that letting the fudge set in the refrigerator overnight made a big difference in the texture, even after it was brought back to room temp.  I used dried cranberries in place of the nuts - orange cranberry fudge!!!  Thanks for a really nice recipe."
83698,280,12/23/2011,5,"This actually came out much better than I anticipated.  I made it with orange extract and walnuts.  I usually spend a ton of time each December baking like mad for my staff, but this year I didn't have time, so I sought out easy recipes.  This was SO quick in the microwave.  After the first batch, I decided I wanted mocha, too, so I made a batch and left out the orange extract.  I added an individual packet of instant coffee to the milk before heating, and it came out perfect.  Thanks for the simple recipe I can use year after year."
222564,280,12/7/2012,5,Just fantastic!
1256030,280,9/14/2013,0,Really really nice. The only thing is that it didn&#039;t settle enough for me to cut pieces. That is probaby because I used a little more milk (400g can).
1800333792,280,11/28/2013,5,"Cadbury Orange Chocolate hello! This recipe is so easy a child could make it and it would turn out. It disappeared as fast as it was made. I used orange extract, 2 tsp., what flavor. I used my microwave for 2 min., mixed it up well with the extract, put it in the pan and let cool, then covered with foil and put it into the frig. 2 hrs. later it was set and ready. My son, husband, daughter-in- law and 3 teenage boys devoured all of it. Thank you very much."
1197624,280,12/31/2013,0,Came out perfect.  Did not need to keep chilled after it had set.  I probably added a bit more zest than listed.
145352,280,10/2/2011,5,Great! Exactly what I had in mind!
140132,280,12/22/2014,5,this is so creamy it practically melts in your mouth.  We loved the hint of orange in this too.  Great addition to our holiday trays. Thank you.
1803605182,280,1/3/2015,5,"Fantastic recipe!  Very easy to follow, even for a rubbish cook like me, and the result was amazing!  I can&#039;t wait to use this recipe again and experiment with flavours!  Can&#039;t recommend it highly enough."
2000789283,280,12/31/2015,5,"Yes!
I made this tasty fudge last night. I love chocolate + orange, so I followed the recipe exactly...including the zest.
I couldn&#039;t believe how fast and easy it was. The texture was smooth, and the fudge was creamy, with a nicely balanced orange flavor. The toasted nuts added crunchy texture. What a win!"
2001334978,280,1/3/2017,5,This looks lovely - I can't wait to try it!
985030,280,10/11/2008,3,"One thing... It might be best not to use wheat flour, as it can be an allergen in dogs. Apart from that it sounds great! Thanks!"
118163,280,9/25/2005,5,"Wow, these were great! I am a hude mushroom fan, and probably a bigger avocado fan so these little guys were jut perfect to me. The thing I added was a little sour cream on the tops of them because I love the combination of hot and cold things. These toasts were creamy, crunchy, juicy, and down right good! They also pair nicely with a glass of merlot. lol. Thanx for posting!"
197023,280,10/29/2005,5,"Chef Kate, these were just SO delicious!  Served these today as a light – but totally sustaining and satisfying – lunch, and I totally recommend this recipe to all who love mushrooms and avocado: a great weekend brunch/lunch dish, or mid-week supper dish.  Quick to prepare, and really scrumptious!  Thank you for sharing!"
58104,280,11/4/2005,5,I cut back on the oil using 1 tablespoon in total for sauting the mushrooms and onions. Didn`t need to top the toasts with any. I found this will serve more then four you can top a whole loaf with the mixture. I enjoy mushrooms and avocados and never thought to put them together. These are great! I used thyme in place of the tarragon. very good and even better knowing I cut more then 1/2 the oil out!
47892,280,11/9/2005,5,"You stole my plans to post this recipe here, Mizz Kate! This is so gooooood!! I love the avocado with all the other ingredients!"
296809,280,7/6/2006,5,"Boy did we ever love this! Except for your bread suggestion, I made this exactly as written. We had it as part of a ZWT appy nite when we tried several things. After adding the avocado & warming it, I stuffed the mix into pita pockets & “dressed” them as directed w/the finishing touches. Was so good that I’ve made it already a 2nd time & will share w/our fishing friends this weekend. Thx for posting."
314579,280,9/19/2006,4,"Kate, this was yummy!  I used small flour tortillas heated under the broiler instead of bread.  I also was out of parmesean, so I used Montrachet goat cheese. Will make this again. (PS. using the new Zaar rating system)"
220582,280,9/30/2006,5,"delish! we modified it a bit for our diet, but used the same basic ingredients. we opted for crisped tortillas, and i cooked everything in a wok to avoid any oil. i didn't have any cheese or herbs, so i just used onion, mushrooms and avacado and drizzled with balsamic. just wonderful."
125388,280,12/28/2006,5,"Very good flavor!  I used 1/2 pound mushrooms and a whole small avocado.  I did not add olive oil and balsamic vinegar to the top, because it didn't seem to need it.  This makes enough for 16-20 baguette slices, not 4."
355920,280,1/21/2007,3,"Very nice, quick, easy meal to prepare. I'm not a 100% sure I would add the tarragon next time. This recipe, as posted, definitely makes more than 4 servings, it's more like 8 rather than 4. All in all, a good meal."
105352,281,2/20/2007,5,This was excellent and itt had lots of flavor. I didn't have any tarragon and substituted basil which worked well. Also I added the olive oil and balsamic vinegar to pan and mixed slightly. Great recipe!
527607,281,2/20/2008,5,"delicious, easy and wonderful.  Great to have with a drink or as a light lunch."
303700,281,9/22/2007,5,"Reviewed for PAC Fall 2007
I LOVE this recipe...I think what really makes it for me is allowing the cukes,onion and potato to marinate in the vinaigrette.
Thanks Adessa!"
28177,282,5/15/2008,5,"Oh what a surprise!  Putting two of my favorite salads together... brilliant!  I love marinated cucumbers (mom did it all the time growing up) & I love creamy potato salad.  This combination of the two is really refreshing.  It was so simple to throw together too.  DH & DS(15) both said it was the addition of cucumber that really made this salad pop.  DD(2) is eating it again for breakfast... hey, when you got a picky toddler you gotta feed them whatever they'll eat!  We will be making this one again.  Thanks for sharing Adessa!  Adopted from the PAC Spring 2008 orphanage."
56003,282,7/29/2008,5,"This was scrumptious!  What a lovely marriage of flavors.  I can't pick out any one thing that is special, because everything is great just the way it is.  Thnx for posting, Adessa."
226863,283,4/15/2010,5,"Lovely tasting potato salad!  Loved the taste of the marinade, and the bonus of the creamy taste.  It was a little ""runny"", but I probably didn't drain mine well enough!  Made for PAC Spring 2010."
124249,283,4/16/2007,5,"Served these at my Easter Tea party. I cut the bread into bunny shapes. Everyone liked them. Thanks Redneck Epicurean for a easy and tasty tea sandwich.

Bullwinkle."
59780,284,4/24/2007,5,We served this as part of my Daughter's 10th birthday party formal tea party. These were a big hit with the kids. I dipped the banana slices into gingerale and then assembled the sandwiches and the gingerale prevented the bananas from getting brown. Thanks for sharing!
79997,287,7/24/2007,5,Your legacy lives on in this delightfully simple recipe packed with flavor.  I like the idea of cutting them into shapes.  This is in my keeper box.
592157,287,8/12/2009,5,Simple and delicious. My little one loved them.
573325,287,2/15/2012,5,"Oh yum, what a great combination of flavours! The banana goes great with the honey and bread making this a truly delightful sandwich. I used a local creamy organic honey and organic bananas with local pumpernickel bread for a wholesome treat. Just great and also very pretty to look at! I didnt measure the honey, just spread it on there. :)<br/>THANK YOU SO MUCH for sharing a keeper with us, Redneck Epicurean!<br/>Made and reviewed for the Honey Tag Game in the Spain/Portugal Forum February 2012."
264017,287,2/24/2008,3,"This was just OK for us. Even with all the listed spices, it seemed to be missing something in the flavor. There was also at least 2 extra cups of sauce that I'll find a use for. Tagged, made and reviewed for the Zaar Chef Alphabet Soup Game."
369715,287,9/25/2008,3,This was good but a bit thick for us. I have a similar recipe but we use more milk. It has a good taste and a little bit goes a long way. I made the recipe as written.
383346,288,2/20/2011,5,Very yummy and great texture.  Thanks LadyRatri :)  Made for New Kids on the Block tag game
2000431022,288,8/26/2015,0,Loved this for breakfast. My husband had to ask for seconds. I added salt for taste. Thanks for sharing
2002158749,288,5/20/2018,4,It went great but one or 2 cracked other than that it went well
2000539634,289,10/9/2015,1,"The standing ovation was for an ice cream I made while working at square one. This is not my original recipe, however. I always called it tootsie roll ice cream. I don&#039;t know why Joyce refers to this as hers.  The only difference in her recipe and mine was that I used half cream and half whole milk and bittersweet chocolate not semi-sweet. The standing ovation was not for this recipe."
265954,290,10/9/2015,3,"This is a good starter recipe. I made as directed and thought it was missing something, maybe some diced onion and celery for crunch. With the barbecue sauce, this dish did not need the additional brown sugar, which made this a little too sweet for us. On the plus side, this is a quick and easy recipe to throw together when pressed for time."
2000462154,290,9/12/2016,5,Quick and easy recipe. Absolutely love it.
39835,290,1/27/2004,5,Chia this deserves more than 5 stars -- rave reviews all around.  Even my non-fish eaters raved about this fish. We had the salmon with a green salad and baked potatoes for a perfect weekday meal. I did subsitute 2 Ancho chilies with a spoonful of adobo sauce for the chipotle chilies (which I forgot to buy)and forgot the sugar but I don't think that made that much of a difference. Thanks for sharing! We will be having this often.
37080,291,6/1/2004,5,"In the words of my DH - GOOD STUFF. He loved it and I couldn't keep him away from the plate when it was cooling. Don't have a toaster oven so I broiled the sandwiches in the oven.  This is going to be had again and again for an easy, quick summer dinner - thanks!!!"
101275,293,6/10/2004,5,"Great sandwiches Chari! Took them for my birthday celebration picnic and we really enjoyed them. I did not toast these as carrying them would make the bread soft anyway. Omitted the chilli because I spread some green coriander-chilli chutney on the bread slices to keep them moist. DH, DS, DMIL, DFIL and Dme;) enjoyed them immensely! Thank you! BTW instead of cake I cut your sandwiches :) Fay   "
727442,294,1/14/2008,5,I love this recipe .. so good.  I used the filling inside pastry sheets to make patties as an appetizer.  They were a hit.  I think I used a regular onion instead of spring onions.
166475,295,12/9/2005,4,"I'm editing my original review because the first time I made these I used all splenda, and THAT was the reason the cookies were dry and crumbly.  However, the second time I made them I DID add another 1/4 cup butter to the recipe, and they came out perfectly, so I would suggest 3/4 cup total butter instead of the 1/2 cup stated. Also, I used a combination of white and brown sugar instead of all white - personal preference, love the taste the brown sugar brings to the table."
682182,297,2/11/2008,5,"Wow!  These are amazing!  I have always had trouble with cookies, but these came out perfect first time!  Thanks for sharing this recipe, family and friends will be enjoying this many times in the future! :)"
931627,297,12/20/2010,4,"It is EXTREMELY hard to get all of the ingredients into a quart jar. My suggestion is to pack the M & M's in a cute little bag and then attach them. I agree with the other reviewer, this recipe tastes very good but needs an extra 1/4 c of butter or an extra egg (this is what I did...turned out great!) or else it is a bit too dry."
152946,297,6/18/2007,2,The topping was pretty good but the actual cake was SO DRY!
88099,298,5/17/2007,4,"We had this last night and enjoyed it.  I decreased the kosher salt to 1 tsp and that seemed to be plenty, and increased the rosemary to 2 tsp.  Grilled these outside and they turned out very moist and tender.  I marinaded them for about 12 hours.  Very nice.  thanks"
900992,298,4/13/2011,2,We thought this was *extremely* salty and didn't care for it.
560491,298,3/13/2013,5,I am not a huge fan of the traditional green bean casserole so to find a new version that is soooo much better is great!  Made with a 16 oz pack if haricot verts that I steamed for 7 minutes rather than boiling.  I also used white cheddar cheese since that is all I had left.  This casserole was very flavorful and paired well with our grilled BBQ chicken.  Made for Photoless Recipe Tag.
89831,300,7/4/2006,5,"This is a wonderful rice recipe! I doubled the ingredients, chopped the onion and increased the garlic to 2 heaping tablespoonfuls, I also added in some toasted almonds and lots of freshly ground black pepper, thanks for sharing this recipe akgrown, we loved it!...Kitten:)"
176615,300,7/15/2006,5,"Great quick side dish with lots of flavor! Really kicks up the flavor of brown rice. I served this with baked chicken and a salad for a simple but wonderful meal. Used a Vidalia onion and because I really let it carmelize in the saute pan, probably could have done without the brown sugar. Would suggest using a bit of the broth to deglaze the saute pan so that all of the yummy bits aren't lost, and of course, homemade chicken stock. Great recipe! Thanks for sharing!"
334558,300,7/18/2006,5,It was a wonderful rice recipe!! I did add an extra clove of garlic! We had this with baked mushroom chicken and a light salad. From now on Im making my rice like this!!!!
141293,301,7/23/2006,5,This was delicious!  Loved the combination of sweet caramelized onion and nutty brown rice.  Will definately make again and again.
322548,301,10/10/2006,5,"Wow! I loved this I made one batch and then another...
usually I'm a brown rice lover but I used white basmati in this to use some up and it was wonderful but brown rice works better. The only other change I made was veg stock for the chicken cause I don't like the dead things. This went really well with mommymakes's spinach balls heaven! "
230331,301,10/21/2006,5,I have never been a big fan of brown rice but this recipe changed my mind.  My husband thought it was okay and he would eat it again.  This is a big step because if it's not rice-a-roni it's not good.  I did use brown basmati rice because I had that to use up and I did it on the stove b/c I have no rice cooker.  Wonderful!
189616,301,7/30/2007,3,"I rarely make brown rice, but the recipe sounded delicious. I'm sure this recipe is fantastic if you like brown rice, so this review is based on our personal taste. I found it okay-too sweet and nutty. My DH no comment-just o.k., my youngest normally a rice lover-it's alright, kind of chewy though my eldest DS-it tastes like crayons (?)he is 13 yrs. old. If I used white rice I'm sure everyone would like it more. I cooked this in the microwave since I don't have a rice cooker.
I served this with recipe#77758 and recipe#67615"
191533,302,8/13/2009,5,"I thought this was a delicious way to make brown rice a little special. I halved the recipe for two of us, but used 1 1/2 cups broth. I omitted the sugar; I think caramelized onions have their own sweetness."
1802198,302,1/21/2011,5,My fiance and I LOVE LOVE LOVE this recipe!!! We first tried it a little less than a month ago and have made it 3 or 4 times. It is the best rice recipe ever.
2590005,304,7/7/2013,5,"Found this recipe on one of those websites where you search for recipes based on the ingredients you already have in your fridge. I just wanted something cheap and easy to make, but this was so, so, so much better than I thought it was going to be, and super cheap. (Like I said, I just made this with things I needed to clean out of my fridge.) If you have a rice cooker, you really need to make this like now. I didn&#039;t use butter, and the chicken broth could easily be substituted with veggie broth, so I think it can be both vegan and gluten free. This would make a fantastic side dish but my boyfriend ate this as a light dinner and were fine, although we did add a little bit of chicken and some mushrooms that needed cooking. Honestly, though, this really doesn&#039;t need anything else, although I think this recipe would do well with some experimentation. Maybe we&#039;ll serve with some broccoli or asparagus on the side next time. Like a previous reviewer, I really caramelized my onions, and they were sweet and brown and flavorful, but I still think that the brown sugar really sent this over the top. Omit the added sugar if it&#039;s really that important to you. Just make sure that you do caramelize your onions--the extra time and effort makes a world of difference. &lt;br/&gt;Seriously. Make. This."
539977,304,12/3/2010,4,"Super yummy!  The sage with the pork was perfect!!  This didn't really need the beans or cranberries, and it cooked dry.  I added water to save the beans. Very salty. Very tasty though. The pork was a huge hit, and those of us who like beans, used the gravy.  LOVED the fresh sage, mine was cut from garden, washed and used. super good herbs"
1383525,304,2/25/2013,5,"This is a great recipe! I have made it twice and the second time, I did it in the crock pot. It turned out perfect both times."
860079,304,1/2/2010,4,"Very nice cocoa ~ I used coconut milk instead of regular and Splenda instead of sugar ~ the cinnamon and vanilla are very nice additions to this. Thanks for posting, made for Comfort Cafe Snow Queens Round, January 2010!"
37449,304,1/21/2010,5,I used almond milk and loved the cinnamon and vanilla! Thanks! Made for the Comfort Cafe-Jan. 2010.
865936,310,12/20/2011,5,"Funny how all the reviewers have changed this recipe, huh?  I made this as directed except substituted Splenda for the sugar.  Came out great!  Not too chocolatey; not too sweet.  I topped it with a squirt of canned whipped cream and a squirt of chocolate-vodka whipped topping too."
169430,310,4/28/2012,5,"Ok, here's the rundown, lol. Used Splenda for the sugar, *dark* cocoa, fat free coffee creamer for most of the milk (for rich taste and body). Loved the touch of salt, it really added some depth. This was truly well enjoyed. :D"
89549,310,12/15/2008,5,"This is a easy and tasty recipe.  I used some Italian sausage I had in the freezer, but I believe it will be better with regular breakfast sausage... just my taste. 
I also used apricot preserves since I had no apple jelly.
I will make this again."
929600,310,12/30/2008,5,"These were fantastic! I made them as the appetizer for Christmas dinner with friends. So quick and easy.  I used 3 lbs. of turkey sausage. 1 lb. regular, 1 lb. sweet, and 1 lb. hot.  Perfect. Thanks for sharing the recipe."
1164201,310,3/9/2009,5,"I substituted BOCA meatless Italian Sausages to cut down significantly on fat content, and it turned out fantastic. I even got enough leftovers for a few days worth of work lunches.
Great, great recipe and now one of my favorites."
1055797,310,7/21/2009,0,"At our Olive Garden this recipe is no longer on the menu,  but they will make it for you if you ask."
2000186415,310,5/5/2015,5,Try using a can of chopped tomatoes with italian seasonings De Freitellies (spelling?) instead of tomoto sauce. I think its better and closer to what you get at Olive garden.
724516,311,5/11/2011,5,"This is a very nice recipe, I didn't add any liquid i.e. stock, mine held well together if it had been dry I would of added it but it was fine I also went for the more seasonings as I think the more flavour the better. I did add a tablespoon of flax meal rather than breadcrumbs and baked it in the oven for 1hour. I would definitely make this again it's very healthy and very tasty. Thank you for posting. Made for Honor thy Mother the diabetic forum May 2011"
239758,314,6/18/2010,4,"Delicious dip and so easy to make. I have industrial-size jars of artichoke hearts and pimento, so I guessed a bit on quantities. I used about 10 ounces of artichokes and 1 1/'2 ounces of pimento -- figuring that drained weight is about 60-70 per cent of the actual posted weight. I still thought something was lacking so added about 1/4 cup of flat-leaf parsley and a very generous hit of salt. Sorry that I missed getting a photo. I finished making it just before I was dashing out the door to take it to an event. Then I let someone else take home the leftovers. I hope to make it again soon and post a photo. Thanks for posting."

29196,314,1/13/2011,5,"I made this 24 hours ahead to allow the flavours to come together. We and our guests loved this and couldn't stop eating it. I made no changes to your recipe, but we all agreed the dip tasted better as it softened and came to room temperature. I WILL be making this reasonable low fat treat again and again and am so glad I found it!"
482376,314,2/5/2012,5,"Delicious appetizer. I love artichokes and feta so I was pretty sure this recipe would be a winner. I love the consistency; perfect for spreading on crackers or for dipping veggies. The flavor is perfect; just enough oregano, garlic and lemon juice. I omitted the pimento. Thanks for a winner!"
383346,314,7/15/2010,5,"This is so yummy.  A great grilled cheese.  I used shard cheddar cheese, so good with the fresh tomatoes and basil.  A swiss cheese would be great also.  Thanks Ellie :)  Made for Newest Zaar tag"

37449,314,3/19/2013,5,I scaled the recipe back for one and used the thin whole wheat buns. It was a little messy but oh so good. Thanks! Made for Rookie tag game.
285039,314,5/19/2013,5,Perfect &quot;burger&quot; to make for both vegetarians and meat eaters ..... just place the mushroom stack on top of a grilled burger or serve as written.  Loved the flavors!
169430,314,11/6/2013,5,Perfection in a bun. I used a bun made with Recipe #462165 recipe. This is so very good as written I think it could become a classic.
124577,314,2/13/2004,5,"I am not a lover of venison,but my daughter gave me some to do up.
I found this marinade,and let me say it was terrific,a little sweet but was very good & very easy to do,enough for 3 venison steaks. .  thank You  Frances Hoover"
242729,314,6/29/2008,5,"I did not know what Wesson Oil was, so I used sunflower oil in its place! I also used Maple Syrup in place of the sugar, as I bought a big jar just for the ZWT tour of Canada!! I minced my onions VERY finely in my food processor. I had no bell peppers handy unfortunately....I am sure that the marinade would be great with them added next time. Thanks DG for the basis of a great and yet such an easy marinade - used on venison steaks today! FT:-)"
687302,314,9/16/2010,5,I made this a few weeks ago & I have to tell you that it converted a few people that would normally refuse to eat venison. Thanks for a keeper!
136997,316,11/4/2005,5,These little gems are so good. I really like the orange flavor and I managed to get 24 nice size cookies out of the batch. :)
206747,316,2/27/2007,5,"I have made these the past 2 holidays for my gift cookie plates.  I use the orange liquer rather than juice.  They are easily put together, and make a nice contrast to all the chocolate and brown cookies, especially with the edge of dipped icing. The orange flavor also makes a nice ""bite"", which is a little different. Thanks for posting, Sharlene."
1179225,316,11/30/2011,5,I have been making these during the holidays for years. I've had the recipe saved in a binder and its stained from use. I love the contrast in texture and flavor. I use craisins for a little more tang. Thanks for posting this great recipe!
375077,316,11/23/2008,5,"Yummy, but left off strawberries.
Thanks for great brunch idea!"
498271,316,10/12/2012,4,Great broccoli!  Loved all that garlic and the saltiness of the cheese.  I had some shredded parmesan/asiago blend on hand so that's what I used.  Easy and tasty - thanks for sharing the recipe!  Made for Fall PAC 2012

324390,318,11/12/2006,5,This tastes like a tropical smoothie!You really taste the coconut! I used frozen strawberries and banana slices which helped to make it extra thick! I'll be making this one again!
422893,318,6/24/2007,4,"This was really yummy, I made a half batch for DD & I to share, great blend of flavours, I did find that the coconut flavour didn't shine through as I would have liked (I did use a home made low fat blend though so possibly not as flavourful as a canned one), will increase that by a little next time, just a personal preference. Made for ZWT III."
382071,318,6/15/2008,4,YUMMY CREAMY FRUITY DELICIOUS! I made this with orange juice and added fresh pineapple chunks. I also used extra ice and added Splenda. Freddy Cat says thanks for the drink! Made for the ZWT4.
590105,321,6/23/2008,5,"Very tasty!  Because I was using frozen strawberries, I didn't use any ice.  A great drink.  Might try orange juice next time, as I ususally have that on hand.  Thanks!  Reviewed for ZWT4."

168896,324,8/1/2007,5,five star cookie recipe. but be warned; these are the type of cookie you cannot stop eating; the texture and taste are great.  i did have to make a few changes; first i changed it to make 21 cookies and the recipe worked out fine.  (i didnt want to have lots of cookies lying around in case they turned out great; good thing i thought ahead!) and i didnt have any fresh brown sugar so had to use sugar in the raw.  i opted to leave out the additional white sugar and i used organic bulk oats so i dont know if they were quick cooking or not.  they were very easy to put together and the taste was super even without the white sugar.  i found them definitly sweet enough.  the texture was nice; chewy and soft but the texture of the oats was detectable which made it have some substance.  i used a chopped up organic dark chocolate candy bar instead of the chips per my daughters request.  they were excellent and will make them again.  thanks for sharing.
155886,324,8/8/2007,2,"Sorry, these were very crumbly.  Perhaps more flour or oats would help produce a more formed cookie."
253462,324,8/12/2007,5,"By far the best oatmeal cookie I've ever eaten.  I didn't find them to be crumbly at all.  
I tend to ""tweak"" recipe's to my liking, so this is what I did - used 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup crisco, omitted the nuts and used very little choc chips.  Was fantastic!  My family and neighbors all loved them."
561296,324,8/14/2007,5,My kids LOVE this recipe!  Great for little hands to help out with :)
262671,324,12/10/2007,5,"Yum Yum Yummy!!! Great cookie for giving away at Christmas time.  I'm packing little gift boxes tonight!!! By the way i used regular oatmeal, and it was delicious, oatmeal kept its texture."
1255784,324,5/1/2009,5,"This recipe is FABULOUS!  Almost every cookie recipe I try turns out horrible, but this one was so easy and turned out just the way it says!  Look forward to making this again soon!"
1306875,324,6/28/2009,5,These were awesome! Definitely recommend them! I left out the cinnamon!
236261,324,9/4/2009,0,Awesome cookies...they were just what I was looking for!  I doubled the batch and used 1/2 butter & 1/2 shortening and they turned out perfect!
1307773,324,11/3/2009,4,"good cookie, thnx"
196341,324,12/25/2009,5,"This is a great cookie! Thanks, Darshirl, for posting this recipe!"
311660,324,2/27/2010,5,These were great!  Stayed soft the next morning and tasted just great.  Thanks for this recipe.
1628888,325,6/6/2010,5,love this recipe!
747588,327,10/10/2010,5,These cookies were excellent!! I added raisins instead of walnuts. My husband ate 'em up.....thanks so much for posting. I'll definitely make these again! :)
160977,327,1/28/2011,3,"Like another reviewer I also added raisins instead of walnuts. The cookies were easy to make and I got 40 cookies, they baked for 15 minutes. Both the chocolate chips and the raisins sort of disappeared, no taste of either in the finished cookie which was very crumbly and stayed that way. <br/>We liked them but I have had better, therefore three stars.<br/>Thanks for posting."
204024,327,9/20/2012,5,"I got fifty chewy, sweet oatmeal cookies and the baking time and temperature were spot on, which has been unusual in my experience. I used chocolate chips and chopped walnuts, and might add raisins for variety in a future batch. Delicious and, for me, a bit nostalgic; we made cookies like this in my small-town childhood. Thanks!"
2950705,327,5/24/2014,5,"Made these tonight and they were fantastic.  Crispy outside, chewy inside.  Will make these regularly."
2000584807,327,10/20/2015,5,"I made these as &#039;healthy&#039; as possible, omitting all refined sugar &amp; flour. I subbed sucanat for the brown sugar (didn&#039;t bother to use/sub the white sugar), oat flour for the all purpose and 63% cocoa chocolate bar chopped instead of the chips. They were great and worked very well with the substitutions for those wanting a healthier alternative."
2000893816,327,2/27/2016,5,"My family loves these cookies! I have made this recipe several times now, and the cookies turn out great every time. I always split the batter and make half oatmeal raisen, half chocolate chip. Both are delicious!"
73951,327,3/31/2017,5,A perfect cookie recipe I will make again and again! Onlychange was subbing in 1/2 cup whole wheat flour. Thank you for sharing!
2001496630,327,4/19/2017,5,THIS IS BY FAR THE MOST DELICIOUS COOKIE I HAVE EVER HAD! I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out perfect... so chewy... sweet.. perfect hint of cinnamon.
2001469482,328,11/11/2017,5,best recipe I have tried so far
2001610686,328,1/3/2018,5,A perfect cookie
2001911082,328,1/4/2018,0,"Very good cookie as written, also made a batch with white chocolate chips. Really tasty as well."
1861735,329,2/8/2018,5,My roommate wanted oatmeal chocolate chip cookies. Anything I've made from this site has been AMAZING!! Both he and his Dad loved these cookies. I did add just 2 1/2 cups of oats. 13 minutes is spot on for the bake time! Thanks so much for a simple tasty cookie recipe. I'll definitely be making these again!
2002016058,329,2/26/2018,0,Best chocolate chip cookie I have ever made!
2002055576,329,3/16/2018,5,Absolutely awesome! I never use quick cooking oats so I just poured milk over my steelcut oats enough to slightly moisten and let them sit 15 min before using. Also omitted walnuts for family preferences and used all demerara brown sugar. Proportions were still right. I was also out of baking soda and used nearly 1 tbsp baking powder. This will be my go-to chocolate chip cookie forever. Thanks for the recipe!!
2000741256,332,5/11/2018,5,"My sister made these and said they were awesome so I decided to try them too. BEST. DECISION. EVER. These were gobbled down by my kids and I within 10 mins of taking them out. I halved the recipe and got 20 cookies. I also subbed the chocolate chips for raisins and half the plain flour with whole wheat flour. I have a fan forced oven so I lowered the temp to 50&deg;c and baked for 14 minutes. My sister told me they wouldn't look done when you take them out but when they cool, they'll harden. This is going to be a favorite recipe around here!!"
49304,337,3/22/2003,5,"Bev, this is so delicious, I served it on mixed greens with sliced mango and pear. Loved the flavor of the port and balsamic vinegar with the spices. The recipe is a keeper, even though my DH didn't care as much for it."
1802989504,339,8/15/2018,5,"BEST oatmeal chocolate chip cookie recipe ever. I have made these 5 or 6 times in the last 5 months! I use mini chocolate chips. Sometimes I grind 7 grains and replaced some of the flour. Other times I just used all 7 grains whole. Tonight I mixed rolled oats 7 grains and quick oats. I like to let the dough rest in the fridge overnight, so we'll see how this batch turns out tomorrow. They always get a great reaction as best cookie ever! Crunchy, chewy and soft in the middle all at the same time! This is the cookie my family, friends, and co-workers ask for!"
2002285688,339,9/27/2018,4,"These turn down out delicious ! Perfectly crisp on the outside and chewy in the middle . I halved the recipe and also got about 20 cookies . My only tweak would be chilling the dough for about an hour , I find it prevents the cookies from spreading excessively . Will definitely be making these again ????"
679953,339,2/3/2009,5,"Wow !! Was this really good !  So easy, and quick.  Its amazing that we saved some for the DS.  This would be great for unexpected company.  I used creamy peanut butter.  Flavoring, prep time, and the results get an A+ here.  Made for Holiday tag."
446523,339,3/25/2008,5,"very yummy.  I used a fresh chilli as i couldn't find canned here in oz.  wow it had a good kick in it lovely for lunch.
thanks 
Made for Edition 4: MAKE MY RECIPEâ€”a game of tag!"
464080,342,4/1/2009,4,"Very nice frittata.  I actually used leftover Recipe #130567 since it had the same ingredients of zucchini, onions and garlic.  I used seasoning salt in place of table salt with great results. I also added a few dots of ricotta around the top of the frittata (since I need to use it up).    I found cilantro leaves to be a great accent to this dish.  Thanks for a tasty breakfast.   Made for MAKE MY RECIPE.  Thanks"
330545,342,6/6/2009,5,A wonderful taste with just enough kick to it.  Made as a breakfast treat on this beautiful Saturday morning unfortunately the element on my stove let go and I couldn't finish this under the broiler-not your fault-or mine-it happens.  Made for Aussie RS#29.
17803,342,8/31/2009,5,I only used 3 cups of zucchini because it looked like a lot of zucchini for 4 eggs.  I also tamed this down a little by using only 2 tablespoons of green chilies because young children were going to eat for lunch.  I used Pace Picante Sauce medium blend to top the frittata.  Made for *Every Day is a Holiday 2009* game.
453440,342,9/3/2017,5,"These stuffed peppers were excellent! DH loved them and said so. He is a diabetic and it was nice to find a recipe that didn't have rice or bread/bread crumbs in the stuffing. STUFFING: I used 1 1/2lb. hot Italian link sausage meat. After browning the sausage, draining the grease and adding the onion (I also added 2 cloves of minced garlic) I noticed that the meat wasn't broken up as much as I wanted. I put a little more than a cup of the meat in my cusinart and pulsed it a few times. That did the trick and I added it together and then added the cheese. (about a heaping cup) Peppers: I used 6 Med. peppers for the incressed amt. of stuffing and placed the filled peppers in my roasting pan. SAUCE: I didn't have any bottled sauce. I used 3 Cups of homemade meatless sauce. Topped each pepper half with a little. Added a little water to the rest of the sauce and added it to the pan. BAKE TIME: I did 15 Min. @ 400 degrees then lowered to 375 degrees for your total cook time. The peppers were perfect. Your total time was spot on. - Thanks for your post. - PS: The leftovers were just as good reheated."
311051,343,11/23/2010,3,"Good, but TOO salty! Between the garlic salt and cheese, no additional salt is needed. And I might even use garlic powder instead of garlic salt next time"
522247,343,2/17/2008,0,"Took a big chance.  The first time I made this was for a big family gathering.  Was a sensational hit.  I do mean everyone wanted the recipe, and they couldn't believe how easy it was to make.  Follow the recipe exactly and you will be worshipped by anyone who takes a bite of it.

131807,343,2/19/2008,4,"This was really good, more like a cake than brownies though.  The cake was fabulous, but I may try the frosting again with less sugar.  Thanks for posting!"
260975,343,5/11/2008,5,These were awesome! Everyone enjoyed them which almost never happens. Made for PAC Spring'08
693345,343,6/21/2010,5,"These are excellent! I took these to a BBQ yesterday, and there wasn't a crumb left. I had actually gotten this recipe in a Cooking Light ad flyer in the mail, and no one could believe it when I told them they were from Cooking Light! The flyer says to bake the brownie layer for 28 minutes, so that's what I did, and they were perfect. I also just used 4 eggs instead of 2 eggs and the egg substitute. After I spread the mint layer on, I stuck the pan in the fridge while I prepared the chocolate layer, because I didn't want the mint and chocolate to swirl together. I actually cut this into 32 squares, which was good, because they are still so sweet, even for being lighter. Several people asked for the recipe. Thanks for posting this!"
1179225,343,6/8/2011,5,I was going to post this recipe and was so happy to see that you had already done it. I have made these for a few years and they are loved by everyone who tries them. They are a must for anyone who loves chocolate and mint together. As an added bonus they are very pretty. Thanks for posting this great recipe!
209747,343,11/20/2009,5,What a fast and easy way to serve a great TexMex meal. Perfect for a busy weeknight or any night. Love that it is so flexible and allows each person to add what they like. I really like that this is made with ground turkey too! Healthier than ground beef. I used reduced fat cheese and baked tortilla chips to make it even healthier. Great recipe! Thanks for sharing it!  *Made for My 3 Chefs*
1179225,343,10/31/2013,4,"Loved the flavors and the end result of this recipe. The directions weren&#039;t very clear. It mentions cooking the broccoli twice, but doesn&#039;t mention broccoli in the list of ingredients. I cooked the tofu and then cut it in strips making it easier to mix with the other ingredients. Thanks for posting the recipe."
2777037,343,4/9/2013,3,"I would give this five stars for taste.  I only gave it three because the nutritional info is way off.  A can of fat free condensed milk is 1,110 calories, 4 ounces of unsweetened chocolate is 560, and two tbs. of the spread is 90.  That added up is 1,760 calories for the whole recipe.  Divide that be eight and you get 220 calories per serving, not the 84 or so stated. BIG difference!"
583349,343,4/18/2010,3,"Nice combination of ingredients, but this was way too much lemon for our tastes, and we like tart foods.  If I make again, I will not have the sliced lemon and probably reduce the lemon juice to 1/4-1/3 cup, and maybe add something sweet to tone down the sourness a bit.  Thanks for sharing.  Made for PAC Spring 2010."
88099,344,4/7/2012,5,"These potatoes were excellent and so creamy.  I loved the hint of nutmeg.  I gave it 3 small shakes, but I'll use more next time.  Used 2% milk and light Smark Balance Butter spread to lighten it up a little.  Loved the addition of the parmesan cheese.  Served this with recipe #413032 and a salad and made for a wonderful meal.  Thanks so much for sharing.  Made for Spring PAC 2012"
286566,345,7/24/2012,4,"The only changes I made where to use less mayonaise (about 1 tablespoon) and used wholegrain/wholemeal toast bread  for 3 serves which served as a lunch for 1 and the other 2 a snack and required a half a hame and salad sandwich each to finish off)   The salad itslef was superb but found the pesto a little overpowering  overall on the sandwich (and I had used less than recommended) and I used basil pesto but would like to try with a tomato pesto which is a little milder and may let the egg shine trhough more.  Thank you Lavender Lynn, made for Make My Recipe."
2549237,345,5/9/2014,4,"This was pretty good.  I followed this almost exactly for lunch for myself and my 3 year old son and we both loved it.  I went to serve this and had bought my bread 8 days before and unfortunately it had molded.  I was so disappointed.  I ended up making lettuce wraps with the egg salad and they turned out well, and actually pretty healthy since it was very low carb.  I felt that the pesto was a little much in this and I will leave it out from now on.  I really loved the bacon in this and was surprised that my picky son ate two who lettuce wraps.  Thanks for a great salad Lavender Lynn.  Made for PAC Spring 2014."
9869,346,8/5/2002,5,"Very tasty soup. My family liked this a lot, I used 2 cans of salmon and chicken stock as opposed to the broth.
Will definitely make this again."
69066,346,1/27/2003,4,Quite good and very worthwhile.  I added a good bit of pepper to down play the taste of the cream style corn.  The chowder went over well at our Superbowl party.
133174,346,12/30/2007,5,"Last night was one of those cold dessert nights and this chowder hit the spot.  I doubled the amount of garlic, eliminated the zucchini and used half and half in place of the evaporated milk.  When I make this again, I may increase the amount of dill weed a touch.  The salmon was a can of pink Alaskan salmon.  This was served with oyster crackers for a warm and comforting meal."
337389,346,1/16/2008,5,Well Mom it was one of those chilly nights in Fla. I had some leftover salmon.Made your Chowder it was wonderful!! I didn't have any zucchini so I left that out. But otherwise follwed your recipe as written. We really enjoyed it. I will definately make this again!!
30534,346,6/24/2011,5,Delicious.  I made the recipe as directed substituting clam broth for the chicken broth.  I needed to add more liquid than speciified in the recipe. Next time I would add more dill.
58538,346,5/25/2003,5,"This was excellent. My husband and I both liked it very much. It was simple to make, yet very rich and more complex than I expected. Thanks!"
158443,346,8/18/2004,5,Fantastic! I made it for a party and received nothing but compliments. Thanks for the recipe.
83093,346,3/8/2007,5,"Totally agree with the other reviewers - this is excellent! I drizzled it over a salad of mixed greens, dried apricot pieces, toasted almonds and feta cheese. It is a tart dressing so I highly recommend eating it with fruit and cheese to smooth out the flavor. Thanks for sharing!"
222564,346,11/29/2010,5,Excellent!
6357,346,12/30/2004,5,One of my favourite smoothies!
69838,346,1/23/2006,5,Fabulous recipe. Made for a great rotisserie chicken.  I have a toaster oven that does rotisserie and a few other things (bake cookies!!) and it worked really well with this recipe :) Hope you like the photo!!!
56680,346,3/7/2006,5,"OK, I made this recipe because I went to make my recipe #43685 and found I was out of the storebought spice I ususally use.  This sounded close and it was PERFEFCT!  I used it called for in my recipe and it came out right on, I think I will not be buying it anymore, just making my own, thanks for a keeper!"
220420,346,3/11/2006,5,"Not only did I impress my DH, and guests with this fabulous recipe,,I impressed myself as well. Next time I make 2 so there will be leftovers. Thank You!!"
25792,346,4/25/2006,5,I wish I had an indoor rotisserie cause I would be doing chickens ALL the time.  I did this on outdoor grill attachment and it was wonderful.  I didnt change 1 thing and only wish I had done 2 instead of 1. When chickens are on sale I will be doing this a lot in the summer and then freezing them. Thanks for a great recipe!
64154,346,4/30/2006,5," Great chicken. I rubbed the outside of the chicken with the spice mixture and rubbed the inside with what was left. Refrigerated for 18 hours. The chicken turned out tender and moist with a great crispy and tasty skin. I would have like the spices to have permeateded the meat more. Thus the 4 stars. Don't know it will work on the rotisserie, but next time I will make several small slits in the skin and rub some of the spices under the skin. I do this to my smoked turkeys. Its a keeper and I will make it again. — Apr 27, 2006

Thanks bailey46

171303,346,6/1/2006,5,This is REALLY a great rub for rotisserie chicken.  I did cut back on the salt and added half mild & half hot paprika and the flavor was just marvelous. The chicken was wonderfully juicy and the skin nice & crispy. Next time I think I'll experiment with some smoked paprika. Thank you Bailey48 for sharing the recipe. 
335737,346,8/15/2006,5,"Oh my, how good! Its a keeper for sure! It is wonderful! I am using the leftover chicken today in Jill4man's ""The best chicken Tortilla soup"". Hope it turns out to be a keeper too, then I'll have to great recipes in one little chicken!"
48920,346,12/26/2006,5,Delicious!  First thing we made on our new rotisserie.  It smelled divine while cooking and the meat just fell off the bone.  Made some awesome sour cream chicken enchiladas with the leftovers.
296846,346,12/29/2006,5,"This is a Great RecIpe,  #296846
I don't care much for Chicken But this recipe changed my mind!! I have cooked this recipe twice per recipe,fantastick !! I'll cook it at lest once a week. Thank you,
 Thank you,  Bailey 46. your great Recipe tasted good,easy for me to cook,and looked WONDERFUL"
49168,346,3/5/2007,5,"We love ""spinning a chicken"" on our rotisserie.  This is a great marinade, I add a squeeze of lemon juice."
29782,346,3/8/2007,5,"This was delicious! I preped this and let it chill all morning til time to put in the rotisserie oven. The seasonings were just wonderful,gave the chicken a delicious flavor and it was so moist and tender. I baked mine for 90 minutes but I did have a 3 pound whole chicken. I also only used half the seasoning measurements since my chicken was smaller than recipe calls for. 
Thanks for sharing your recipe bailey46! Its a keeper :)"
433021,346,3/22/2007,5,So far this is the best Rotisserie Chicken my family has had. My kids ate all the leftovers. And that says alot. Thank you for posting.
230331,346,5/17/2007,5,Thanks for a great recipe!  This was excellent.  We just got a new grill and bought a rotisserie for it and couldn't wait to use it.  I had a very small chicken and used all the spices inside and out.  As it was cooking I wanted to pick pieces off it smelled that good.  And when it was time to eat it tasted even better.
401711,346,5/24/2007,5,Fantastic! Since going gluten free I can't have the deli chickens anymore and I decided to make my own. This is better than any deli chicken I've ever bought! Thanks!
88099,346,7/6/2007,5,Excellent chicken.  Loved the combination of flavors in this. Perfect
949194,346,9/8/2008,5,Very good â€“Â perfect recreation of a favorite restaurant. I substituted the chicken thighs for thin chicken breast; and then did a quick pan fry of everything in there.
430663,346,7/9/2007,5,"While mixing the seasoning blend, I had to stop and write my thoughts...this is the most wonderful combination of spices that I have ever tasted! I had recently discovered a Caribbean Jerk seasoning that I loved, but your blend is far better! I cannot wait to try the finished chicken dish...I am sure thaqt it will also be a 5-star rating!

Post note:  The chicken came out perfect after exactly 1 1/2 hours in my rotisserie oven.  The meat was full of flavor...thanks for a great recipe!"
491949,346,8/18/2007,5,Excellent recipe.  I cooked in in my counter-top rotisserie and i came out great.  My family is already asking for me to make this again.
215898,346,8/23/2007,5,"We had technical difficulties with the rotisserie so ended up cooking this in the oven, but everyone loved it!  The skin was crispy and flavorful, and the meat was juicy and tender.  I plan to make this spice mix in quantity and store it for easy use."
515964,349,10/7/2007,5,This came out just as it says juicy with a crisp skin. I did'nt even marinade it and it was still absolutley delicious.
53868,350,2/10/2008,5,"Absolutely delicious. I had never thought of marinating the chicken overnight with a rub on it; it really helps the flavor permeate the chicken. We used two smaller free-range chickens on the rotisserie; it worked fine. The skin wasn't really that crispy, but who cares? It was incredibly juicy and yummy anyway."
454149,350,3/28/2008,5,"We love this chicken, but you have to make sure that you season the inside cavity as well as the outside. I even used the full amount of paprika, when ususally we cut it also because its too spicey for us. Thanks for the recipe!"
585211,350,7/2/2008,5,We love this recipe!  thank you so much for posting it.  My family LOVES this chicken.
650938,350,9/25/2008,5,I use this every time I rotisserie a chicken now.  It is perfect...The whole family can't get enough.
11176,350,11/25/2008,5,"GAAH! I need moar! Oh wait... I have the recipe, I'll just make another one. This was my very first use of a rotisserie and I'm not turning back. The seasoning was SO good, I had to eat the crispy skin, too. There, I said it. I ate the skin! Many thanks for this wonderful recipe, bailey46!"
952408,350,12/8/2008,5,This was my first time cooking with a rotisserie! I will probably experiment more but this recipe has been saved in my cookbook. I grill ribs and will use this on them.   VERY TASTY!
434493,351,1/25/2009,2,I really didn't care for this recipe at all.  I will going onto the next recipe for rotisserie chicken.
520002,351,3/12/2009,5,"Very good. Did on rotisserie with chicken legs. I added 1 tsp. Pappy's seasoning and 1 tsp. lemon zest also. Next time I will add 1 tsp. corriander instead of thyme. Good flavor, everyone liked."
251626,351,6/21/2009,5,Loved it.
169969,352,7/14/2009,5,"I agree with love4culinary, fabulous recipe. I only let the seasonings sit on the chicken for about an hour before I put it in the rotisserie. It was wonderful with excellent flavor! Thanks for posting!

7/14/09 Made this for dinner tonight and it was as fabulous as I remembered!"
494440,352,12/20/2009,5,"I used curry powder instead of chili powder due to availability here in China, and I'm sure this changed the taste a bit, but still quite a wonderful rub for the chicken.  Came out delicious."
1477212,352,1/6/2010,4,Seemed to be what we were looking for.
302094,352,1/31/2010,5,We had to grill our chicken  our rotisserie wasn't working. This tasted great and everyone loved it. Thanks for posting!
844554,352,2/15/2010,5,I don't have a rotisserie so I baked mine in the oven. I used this recipe for the spices -- it looked like a combo of what I was looking for and it was. It was very good. Thanks for giving me another choice for chicken!
1527940,355,5/5/2010,5,"FantasticRecipe!!! Made right by the recipe, didn't change anything. Refrigerated about 6 1/2 hours. While cooking it smelled great. In my GF rotisserie I cooked 17 min. per pound, per GF instructions. What left overs? Next time I will make 2. This was so good, don't think it could be better. Thanks bailey46."
317606,355,5/15/2010,5,Most excellent!  My husband and I fixed two whole chickens on our grill rotisserie on our Broil King and cooked for a little over 1-1/2 hours.  This rub is fantastic!  Best rotisserie chicken ever!  I will definitely use this recipe all the time for rotisserie chicken!  Thanks!

648882,355,7/18/2010,5,"Love-Love-Love this!  No more grocery store rotisserie chickens for us.  This is now a Monday routine.  We have chicken to snack on, chicken sandwiches for lunch and whatever is left in a couple days makes a delicious chicken salad."
439759,355,8/15/2010,5,"Great recipe!  I used our Member's Mark Grill at 350 degrees with only the far right burner burning.  It took over 2 hours to get it to 175 degrees, but that could have a lot to do with our high altitude.  I think next time I will up the cooking temperature to 400 degrees for the first 20 minutes and then bring it back to 350 and see what happens.  I stuck some rub betweend the skin and meat and it tasted wonderful.  The meat was also very juicy.  Thank you!"
8629,355,8/22/2010,4,"This was the first recipe I tried on my Showtime Rotisserie. Based on instructions for the Showtime Rotisserie,  I set the timer for 1 hour and 15 minutes for the 4 lb. chicken.  That timing was fine. I liked these seasonings very much."
192849,355,9/11/2010,5,Made rub as directed as prepared chicken the morning  before I cooked it.  It had about 34 hours to absorb all that goodness.  Threw it on the rotisserie for 90 minutes.  The smell as it cooked was incredible.  This was the best rotisserie chicken I've made.  DH and I were licking our fingers.  Thanks for sharing!
135887,355,5/23/2011,5,Made as directed.  My 5 lb chicken was ready in 1 hour 45 minutes using the rotisserie on our gas grill.  Very moist and tasty results.
447742,355,9/10/2011,5,"We don't have a rotisserie, so I used this recipe for the rub only, and add a generous 1/4 tsp of ground cayenne pepper - Very tasty!  I'll then either bake in the oven, or cook in the crock-pot.  The crock-pot method makes for a flavorful, fall-off-the-bone chicken. Mmmmm..."
19372,356,5/28/2012,5,"Wow!  My hubby picked up a chicken and hinted we should use the Rotisserie.  Today I decided to do just that.  The only thing I did different from this recipe was I used a brown sugar blend instead of regular sugar. The smell flowing through the house had everyone drooling. This was SO good!  We had company come by and they loved it, too. Thanks so much for posting it!"
173579,356,6/29/2012,5,Very good recipe for rotisserie chicken.  We all liked it.  Thanks for posting.
2291867,356,7/2/2012,5,Absolutely the best deli chicken....a family favorite.
889181,356,8/23/2012,0,"Wow! was this ever delicious and easy! I came home from work, mixed up the spice rub, rubbed it on the chicken, put chicken in refrierator for 2 hours, sat on the veranda having a cocktail, put chicken on rotisserie on the bbq, and 45 minutes later, dinner was done. the chicken was moist and flavourful.I served with boiled new potatoes with dill and butter and some little tomatoes from the garden made into a salad. the Chicken was the star of the night. Well done, bailey46! a new regular meal in our household."
2764527,356,3/31/2013,5,Amazing recipe &amp; so easy as my hubby did all the work =) We didn&#039;t use the sugar - that is the only change.  We will make this again &amp; again &amp; again!
176481,356,6/17/2013,4,"Made this for our grillin&#039; weekend.  We used 2 half bone-in breasts.  I love the skin, but my boyfriend doesn&#039;t so I rubbed some of the spices inside the skin as well as on top.  I thought it was good, not fantastic.  I personally didn&#039;t feel the spices were balanced, some overpowered others.  The chicken was still very juicy.  We will do this again but tweak the spices a bit.  Thanks for posting, it gave us a foundation to work with."
2156777,356,5/13/2014,5,"This is my new favorite recipe for rotisseries.  It is sooooo good.  I didn&#039;t let the chicken sit with the rub for a few hours and it was STILL good.  Also, I know it is recommended to wash the chicken, but as gross as this may sound, Consumer Reports recently said it is best not to wash chicken as the bacteria will go away with cooking and washing it spreads the germs around the kitchen.  Just a thought.  If you don&#039;t want to know that bit of info., just don&#039;t eat at my house -- I follow Consumer Reports :).  Overall, a very good recipe, left the chicken outsides crispy and my kids&#039; insides full.  Thanks for sharing."
1802734451,356,7/13/2014,5,I adjusted the recipe for a 5 lb chicken and the following ingredients. And it was absolutely delicious. I had no garlic powder so I used garlic salt. But I also used the recommended salt it also called for. Instead of regular chili powder I used Hot Mexican Style Chili Powder and also added equal amounts of Brown sugar to the rub. I mixed all ingredients well and put into empty herb container and sprinkled evenly over evoo rubbed roast inside and out. Marinated in fridge 24 hrs. Made a delicious crispy amber brown skin and juicy throughout. It&#039;s a keeper.
12657319,356,12/31/2014,5,"Outstanding recipe and beats the grocery store chickens by a mile. I used a grille pan with ridges to hold the chicken off the drippings and then convection baked a 4.15lb bird for 1:30 at 350 actual degrees (setting for 375) for the first half hour, then tented with foil for the last hour. I increased the temp to 400 for the last half hour. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Came out superb. Baked it weighed 3lbs,and when I took all the meat off, I got 2lbs.  I paid $1.79 per lb and it was the equivalent of buying boneless skinless for $2.99 after getting rid of the bone, but tasted way better. The skin and bone adds a ton of flavor, as does this rub. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I found smoked paprika at trader joes and it worked really well. It gave it a BBQ potato chips sort of flavor that was very very subtle. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Less than a week later, I&#039;m making another, larger one. It&#039;s that good!"
2000161637,356,8/24/2015,3,"No oven temperature is given :-(

I&#039;ll try:

 Cook for 15 minutes at 425&deg;F, 220&deg;C  and then reduce the heat to 375&deg;F, 190&deg;C

And no rest time is given either - about 15 minutes before carving the chicken."
1802582540,356,10/16/2016,5,"This was great. We are doing low carb so I was looking for rub with no sugar. Perfect! I spatchcocked the chicken and rubbed season on generously. Put breast down on hot BBQ (450) for 15 mins, flipped for 30 minutes. Until temp reached 165F. Will make again and again. Ty"
2001289013,356,12/9/2016,5,Great rub! Chicken was really moist and tasty!
2001345092,356,1/29/2017,5,"Delicious!!! This was my first rotisserie, I have always bought mine from Costco but this recipe beats them all. I will never buy another rotisserie chicken again!"
2001356191,356,1/17/2018,4,"Overall, it was very good. Can't say I was entirely blown away but I recognize that part of that could have been because I couldn't follow all the directives to a &quot;t&quot;. Here are a few things I did differently: I didn’t find this recipe until right before I was going to put the chickens in the oven so I didn’t have the benefit of letting it soak in the rub ahead of time. I just made it up and put it directly in the oven. I doubled the recipe (I had two chickens) but kept all of the spice ratios the same except for the chili powder – which I cut in half (because we’re wimps). I used coconut sugar instead of regular for a smidge extra nutrition. I liberally seasoned the inside of the bird as well (and still had rub left over). We have a rotisserie but I didn’t have time to fiddle with it so I just made them on a rack, in a roaster, in the oven at 400. I did have to move them around after a bit as the rub was getting too dark. Next time, I’d like to try this when it has a chance to marinate overnight first and then do it on the rotisserie for the full effect. Still, it got good reviews from the fam. The skin was crisp and had flavor and the meat was juicy and tender. The reason for only 4 stars is, the rub itself was good but it didn't totally knock my socks off. I might tweak some of the seasonings for a better balance and outcome as it speaks to our particular taste buds (e.g.: more garlic powder and black pepper and maybe rub with melted butter instead of oil). Worth the try and will look forward to making it again. Thanks for the good dinner!"
2001965699,356,2/1/2018,4,It was good. Just did not think it was great.
2001971575,356,2/3/2018,5,"This was really yummy, best to do the make ahead so it has time to marinate in the spice rub, makes a difference in the flavor profile! Also READERS, this is a ROTISSERIE chicken recipe so there will be no oven temperature settings. READ the title of the recipe and then actually READ the recipe- it's stated there too! I love how people get all bent out of shape about something and get all mean and nasty but it's simply because they don't READ THE RECIPE!!! lol"
2002002895,356,5/12/2018,5,I'm glad I found this recipe! My friend gave me a George Foreman rotisserie oven a few months ago and I finally put it to use. The chicken turned out juicy and delicious. I'm so excited that I can add this recipe to my collection.
2000927928,356,9/21/2018,5,"I used some of the seasoning in the cavity of the bird and trussed it. Put it on the rotisserie on my gas grill set at 350-375 degrees with a disposable pan under the bird with chicken stock and butter in it. Temped at 1 hour, not done. Temped at 1-1/2 hrs and was perfect. Thighs were 175 and the breast was 165. This was amazing!!! Kinda hard to get excited about a rotisserie chicken but this recipe is a keeper. Oh yeah. I also used a smoker box with hickory pellets in it to give the bird a kiss of smoke."
254614,358,4/13/2006,5,"I put some Hormel cooked bits and pieces in my eggs with butter. Good! I cooked another with margarine, eggs and cheese whiz for DH and he liked with pepper.You are so right, no mess! Amen."
95743,360,4/14/2006,5,"Left this recipe out on the kitchen counter with a note to Dh that he might like it for breakfast.  When I got up he had left me a thank you note and instructions to cook the eggs for two minutes with a sprinkling of cheese.  Thanks for a no-fail, tasty recipe, Krsi Sue."
310874,360,4/14/2006,5,"I have been making something very similar at work for a while now, except I microwave it the same way in a coffee mug.  :)  Yummy breakfast!"
342784,361,8/24/2006,5,"A quick and easy way to make scrambled eggs.  Three minutes would have probably scorched my eggs so I'd recommend paying close attention after each minute.  Also make sure that you get a light layer of oil on all parts of your bowl or else you'll get a couple of parts that stick like I did.  If not for that, I could easily just rinse out the bowl and be done cleaning!  Definitely should add some meat, diced onions, cheese or something to help make this recipe even more flavorful else it's just a scrambled egg in a no-stick bowl."
176843,361,2/9/2007,4,Thanks for reminding me how simple it is to make a quick egg or two for breakfast!!  I used to do this all the time when I was a single 20-something and didn't want to take the time to cook.  I tried this out for myself using only egg whites and some soy cheese and it was as satisfying as I remember!
324993,361,2/15/2007,5,Love it! Easy and tasty!
377581,361,5/8/2009,4,It's easy to cook. I added a slice of american cheese a minute before it was ready. Made a great breakfast with hash browns and thick sliced toast. Thank you!
499050,361,8/29/2009,4,Very Good.
863904,361,9/3/2009,0,as i am yet to try this i will refrain from starring this recipe just yet. but i will say this sounds a great recipe and i will try this - should be a nice and easy thing to make for my toddler on those cold mornings or even as a side with his dinner! thanks for the idea:)
400708,361,12/22/2010,5,"This was such a fun recipe, easy and quick and actually looked really pretty on the plate.  I had an extra egg yolk left over from making meringue cookies so added that to it with some fresh grated chedder cheese and it puffed up like a cheese souffle (sp)and did at the pat of butter on the plate.  What a great idea when you are in a hurry and don't want to make a mess.  Think this could have a lot of additions, maybe bacan or ham - yum and what an easy way to make that egg bagel sandwich in the morning."
350750,361,11/20/2011,5,I often make these eggs for my toddler son and he loves them.
121690,363,7/28/2006,4,"This is when I'm so sorry that I'm a chef without a camera. This salad is just supremely beautiful. I served it on a bed of baby spinach which set off the colors very well. The combination of ingredients in the salad melds together well.  The ratio of oil to lemon juice in the dressing, though, dilutes the lemon presence enough that it comes through only faintly. I think the next time I make the salad, I'll try adding a bit of grated lemon zest to the dressing to up the lemony tang I was looking for. Still, I will definitely be trying it again. Thanks, Caroline Olivia!"
374416,363,3/27/2007,4,"This was very pretty!  I added about 1/4 cup of chopped carrot and 1 more avocado (since I had it).  As in the previous review, I thought that it needed a little more lemon flavor.  Adding some lemon zest, more lemon juice, or maybe 1 lemon, sectioned, would probably do the trick.  This would be yummy as a wrap or stuffed in a pita!  Thanks kiwi, I will make this again!"
377070,364,6/15/2007,5,"*edit June 15, 2007 - I initially gave this recipe a four star rating.  Since then I've found myself telling people about it and having cravings for it.  That tells me I totally underrated it the first time.
This was a very good salad and will definitely be making again. I had a large group to feed so added 6 cups of baby spring greens and used small shrimp instead of large. I did add 1 Tbsp more lemon juice to the dressing but it wasn't quite enough for our tastes. We like a bit more of a bite, so next time I think I'll add 3 Tbsp of lemon juice plus some dijon mustard and a dash or two of hot sauce. Maybe even a wee bit of minced garlic too."
872058,365,6/25/2008,3,"These chosen ingredients are fabulous together (color and taste-wise) but this recipe needed much much more salt, pepper and lemon juice to make the flavors come out. I used fresh everything for the ingredients. I am pretty sensitive to too-salty foods so I was surprised that I needed to use more than 2 tablespoons of Krazy lemon salt to give all the ingredients the normal level of flavor. I would definitely make this again but with some adjustments to the lemon, salt and pepper measurements."
199848,366,6/18/2012,5,"I loved that this salad had a light, lemony taste and not bogged down by heavy mayonnaise.  I used extra-large shrimp.  I think the bigger the shrimp, the better for this salad.  This is a great alternative to lettuce-based salads, although this would be great served on a bed of green or lettuce.  Thanx for sharing!"
2001343889,366,1/9/2017,0,"I was looking for a recipe to using up and excess of shrimp and celery I had left over. Every other recipe I found needed &quot;two cups of mayonnaise.&quot; But this recipe does not and proves that artery clogging mayonnaise does not need to be the base of a delicious, healthy salad. I've made it five times in the last two months since finding it. Thank you so much."
380862,373,5/3/2007,5,These are easy and delicious! They are always a hit at my parties.
128473,374,3/16/2011,5,"These were excellent Luckydevil.  I used jalapeno pepper jelly couldn't find peach pepper jelly. These tasted so much better than my pictures look.  Quick and very easy to make. Love brie, love puff pastry and pepper jelly, tailer made for me.  Thanks so much for sharing.  Made for Pac 2011."
424680,374,11/27/2008,5,"An interesting way to make a Monte Cristo! I actually cut the recipe in half & that, along with a bowl of soup, made a great lunch for 2 of us (not to mention cutting way back on the calories, fat, cholesterol, etc)! Not something I'd make often, but since this is one of my very favorite sandwiches, well . . . Thanks for a great recipe! [Tagged, made & reviewed as part of my Lunchtime Sandwich theme in My-3-Chefs]"
228392,374,12/31/2007,5,"I made this for a surprise birthday party on Saturday and got great compliments on it.  Because we had quite a few people invited to the party, I doubled the cream cheese and sour cream and used about a cup of hot sauce. I didn't have a can of chicken, so I used some finely shredded chicken that I had in the freezer and had thawed. I will definitely be making this again!"
538563,374,12/23/2008,5,"This is a really good and really easy dip to make. I didn't add as much hot sauce as the recipe calls for, as I wanted my daughters to be able to eat it. I added 2 teaspoons of chili powder to add extra flavor without the ""heat"" of the hot sauce. Great recipe!"
174096,374,1/17/2010,5,"This is great!  The meat comes out so juicy and flavorful!  I omitted the salt and used fat free Greek yogurt with the hummus.  So good!  I took advantage of a good sale on chicken leg quarters, so I cooked both thighs and drumsticks this way and used the thighs as directed.  The drumsticks were great sliced over a salad with Greek dressing for lunch the next day!  Thanks for sharing!"
1329782,375,1/26/2010,5,"Very good.
I used a combination of 4 breasts with bone in and 6 thighs, because it was what I had, so I used a bit more marinade, but same ingredients.  I did let mine marinade all day which I thought really helped.

I grilled mine, but only took 30 minutes to grill, it says 1 hour. Mine was 30 minutes and perfectly tender.  I did baste as directions stated.

I used seedless cucumbers and plum tomatoes, also seeded, otherwise, the Naan (I had it on hand, so I used that but Pita would of been great) would of got too wet for me. I added, black olives rough chopped as well which I like with the flavors and I had a 1/2 of can so why not use them up.

Very good, will make again.  A great sandwich
Thx!!"
1800103922,375,10/5/2013,3,"Very good! Not quite like the ones you get on the street in New York or Europe, but very close and my craving was satisfied! I recommend this recipe to anyone craving a D&ouml;ner kebab! These are tasty and pretty easy to make too."
1802533639,375,2/27/2014,5,"Absolutely yummy. It tastes as good, if not better than the chicken doner from my local kebab house."
806937,375,8/16/2009,4,Very good and moist. I made a 1/2 recipe and will add some chocolate chips to the cheesecake part next time.
4470,376,9/8/2009,5,Very nice but I used Tony Chachere's Roux Mix instead of making it from scratch. I had to make adjustments to the recipe as a result. Also I cannot get craw fish so I used artificial crab. It did end up as a very tasty dinner. With all the adjustments due to my laziness I cannot in fairness take away stars so will make it a 5 star - I am sure it deserves it because even with all my fiddling this was still a very tasty dinner . When I can get crawfish I will make this recipe again and make the roux from scratch.  I didn't think that using the Instant Roux would give me so many problems.
895132,376,12/6/2009,5,"Clear five stars!!! Actually made it to use in recipe #306275 but it's fantastic on it's own! Maybe because I used rice syrup instead of sugar and 80 percent chocolate instead of 65 percent it's extremely smooth and velvety. I don't like those watery chocolate sorbets, so this one definitely is it for me! This will be my standard chocolate sorbet.
Thanks for posting!"
346338,376,9/9/2006,5,"I made this a few years ago, from the godiva chocolate website. Absolutely 1000% fab, should have 10 stars cannot say enough about it,honestly speechless, Its only downfall is time and can be tricky. but if you choose to make it you will not be dissapointed."
42586,376,1/2/2003,5,"I'm trying to learn better ways to cook oatmeal so that I'll enjoy eating it more often.  This is really good!  I really liked a different baked oatmeal dish, so thought I would try this one.  This one is nothing like the other, but is also really good.  I used blueberries instead od cranberries.  It is nice to eat oatmeal that isn't too sweet!  Thanks!"
22015,376,5/25/2004,5,This is wonderful!  Very flavorful.  The oatmeal isn't mushy - it's still a bit chewy -just the way I like it.  I cut the recipe in half except for the butter and brown sugar - I used less than half of those.  It worked out very well.  I think that this would be great in Cooked Oatmeal Scones #46876.  I'll make extra next time so that I can do just that with the leftovers.  Thanks for a great recipe.
104847,376,9/14/2004,5,"This was great.  Easy to make and have ready for the morning.  I made small changes with what I had available.  used maple syrup instead of sugar, 4 1/2 T ground flax in place of margarine, 1 c. apple, raisins instead of cranberries, and 2/3c. chopped almonds.  "
86855,376,9/20/2004,5,"This makes such a nice autumn breakfast! And it looks really pretty too! I used half cranberries and half raisins. Also, I didn't have 3 cups of milk on hand, so I substituted some water to make a total of 3 cups liquid. The leftovers are delicious too! Thanks for a wonderful recipe, Tish!"
140806,376,12/27/2004,5,Surprisingly easy recipe. I made this Christmas morning and it turned out perfect. I used orange craisins which enhanced the wonderful flavor even more. This became a recipe that I will look forward to making every Christmas.
2001017894,376,5/19/2016,5,I loved the recipe...it came out perfect the first time I tried!!
173838,376,2/15/2005,5,"Thanks, Tish, for a new breakfast favorite!  I halved the recipe, as well as mixed cranberries with raisins.  It turned out great--smelled wonderful when it was baking too!   I appreciate a baked oatmeal recipe that doesn't call for eggs.  I think any baked oatmeal is especially tasty, however, because the flavors blend well while baking.  Thanks again!"
21173,376,6/5/2005,5,"Excellent! I had some left over and am going to see if it freezes well, as i think it could make a great microwave quickie breakfast option. The DH wanted to have a second bowl!"
182358,376,7/23/2005,5,"Yummy!  I made the recipe as posted but omitted the nuts b/c was preparing for granchildren. I also used a mixture of dried berries (cherries, cranberries, blueberries) and tossed in a cut up banana as I needed to use  some up. My DS and DIL loved it. I really enjoyed the dried fruit and will definitely be making this recipe again.  Thanks for sharing, Tish!"
95743,376,11/10/2005,0,"Made this just as written, expecting to like it, but I'm afraid neither one of us cared for it.  Just a personal taste thing, I guess."
215898,376,2/26/2006,0,The flavor was good but we didn't care for the texture. I wish I could be more specific but I can't seem to find the right words. Judging by the other reviews it may just be a personal taste thing.
119708,376,4/23/2006,5,I didn't do the star thing!!  Ooops...is certainly a 5'er.  I have made this again and even my dh liked it and he won't touch oatmeal!  His mom raved about it from the brunch so he gave it a try...
100185,376,5/13/2006,4,"I liked this except it was very very sweet, and I didn't even use the whole amount of brown sugar.  But the rest of it was good and I'm sure I'll be making it again, and maybe use only 1 tablespoon of sugar."
133174,376,9/24/2006,5,Great recipe!  I used Splenda brown sugar blend and reduced the amount of cranberries and pecans to 1/2 cup each.  The one thing I really enjoyed about this recipe is there is no overnight preparation.  It is quick and makes for a delciious breakfast.
271347,376,1/13/2007,5,"Excellent!  I use fresh, whole cranberries, upping the quantity to 1 1/2 c. and doubling the brown sugar.  To reduce calories, skip the margarine and/or butter, you don't really need to oil the pan. 

I make this sometimes a day ahead of when I have overnight company; just reheat in the morning for a plentiful, tasteful breakfast."
47892,376,2/11/2007,5,"I live off oatmeal in the cold months and this was a very delicious recipe! Very minor changes: grated the apples instead of chopped, almonds because I was out of the other nuts, and a combination of dried orange essence cranberries and dried blueberries. To serve, I sprinkled some salt on top and also a sprinkle of brown sugar. Half and half cream was served on the side. Thanks for sharing."
181123,376,4/7/2007,5,Great!  The combo of apples and cinnamon is a winner!
404046,376,6/22/2007,5,"This is my favorite recipe for oatmeal in the morning!  It has a great balance of cinnamon, sweetness and crunch from the nuts.  The only change I've done is 2% milk and butter instead of margarine.  Thank you, Tish!"
540680,376,10/9/2007,5,"Delightful...I've tried this with several kinds of nuts and raisins instead of cranberries...quite a filling ""Good morning,"" from the world of oats."
719493,376,2/23/2008,5,Wonderful!!!!  Great for the weekend and for company!!
664685,376,3/3/2008,5,"From the hands of a novice chef--really great!  Made one pan for my family and another for my girlfriend and it was gone.  This is a keeper.  I added more cranberries than the recipe called for.  Apples seem to be optional, don't reallyl add much (next time, I will try w/o)."
28177,376,5/3/2008,5,"Loved the balance in this oatmeal. The top baked up nice & firm with a dry appearance, but the underneath was soft & moist. I used one granny smith apple, 2% milk, cranberries & pecans.  I think that even though it wasn't a full 1-1/2 cups, the tart apple was a prominent flavor.  The brown sugar was plenty to sweeten the recipe & since we don't usually put milk or yogurt on oatmeal (pers pref), we enjoyed this recipe plain.  DH was experiementing with maple syrup & with butter. He didn't like it with syrup at all (too sweet), but thought it best with a dab of butter mixed in. DS, DD & I ate it plain. I love that this recipe can be made with staple ingredients. I usually like to make the first recipe as printed, and since I'll be making this again I'm going to use dried cherries & add a touch of almond extract to the mixture next time. Thanks for posting Tish, this is a fantastic recipe!"
540142,376,5/9/2008,5,"sooooo good. everyone loved it! i used vanilla soymilk instead of regular milk, also i would use less sugar next time, it was a little too sweet for me, but overall, wonderful!"
207668,376,5/21/2008,5,"Easy enough for my older children to prepare without help and yet so delicious that everyone wants seconds!  

I used rice milk since we are a no-dairy family, and omitted the apple as I had none.  Still absolutely wonderful.

Thank you for a flexible recipe that is sure to become a breakfast staple in our home."
362983,376,12/11/2008,5,"Delicious oatmeal! Now why was I making oatmeal in the microwave all this time???? This was actually really fun to make and easy to put together. I loved that you didn't have to let it soak overnight like other recipes. The only changes I made was cutting down the sugar (though I might add the listed amount to compare next time) and I used half cranberries, half raisins. I think I might have added too much milk because it didn't firm up, so I'll try cutting that down next time too. I can't wait to try this with different fruits and seasonings. Thank you!"
46357,376,10/8/2009,5,"This is really good! I agree - might never eat oatmeal any other way from now on. I've made it twice and now add about 1/2 tsp salt, extra tsp of cinnamon and 1 tsp vanilla to the milk mixture. This seems to bring out the flavors better. YUM!!

FYI, it's 5 WW pts per serving without the nuts."
237123,376,1/12/2010,5,"loved it.  I really changed it quite a bit, but you provided me with the perfect proportions, temp and time.  I used a 10 grain hot cereal, almond milk, agave nectar, cinnamon, almonds and apples.  I divided it up into 6 sections to eat for breakfasts during the week.  I would make this again for sure."
225620,376,3/21/2010,5,"I loved this recipe! My only adjustment was to leave out the nuts, personal preference. I used a large apple for which I do not know the measurement. I also let the oatmeal sit for about five minutes before cutting and serving to allow the liquid to be soaked in, again personal preference. This will be great to reheat before work in the morning."
704479,376,6/15/2010,5,"Just got around to rating it now, but it's a Saturday morning staple in our household.  Great texture, great taste, very simple. Thank you!"
421511,376,1/10/2011,4,"Very good!  I didn't have any apples on hand, so left them out.  I did use vanilla almond milk, so I decreased the brown sugar to 3 tbs and found it to be the perfect sweetness.  It took about 40 minutes.  Next time, I''ll bump up the temp to 375.  I'm looking forward to trying to this with other dried fruit/nut combos.  Thank you for posting!"
213139,376,2/6/2011,5,"DD has been asking for baked oatmeal for several weeks and I finally got around to baking some for her.  I used dried cherries as I had some that needed to be used up, a granny smith apple and pecans (our favorite nut for baking). It smelled heavenly while baking and the taste was wonderful.  A nice change from regular oatmeal.  Will definitely make this again.  Thanks for posting this Tish!  Made for Healthy Choices ABC Tag."
302094,376,3/21/2007,4,I just made this for dinner as a side dish to my southwest tamale pie. The only changes I made was to add Thousand Island dressing thats all I had on hand. I also added kidney beans instead of ranch style beans. I forgot the cheese but it was still tasty. Thanks for a quick side dish for dinner.
60908,378,11/13/2002,5,"Hi Georgieanna,

Growing up in Louisiana, this is exactly the way my Mama would make ""Lost Bread"". I'd forgotten all about it. Now I'm going to fix it for breakfast tomorrow morning. Thanks for reminding me with the recipe! By the way, I live nearby in Covington."
160213,378,9/18/2004,5,"We were looking for a simple classic French Toast just like mom would make,and we found it. Thank you..        P.S. I am also from southern Louisiana,Morgan City "
371105,378,4/1/2007,5,this definitely the way my children are going to grow up eating frech toast.
126104,378,10/6/2007,5,"I have absolutely never heard of ""lost bread"", and this wasn't how I have always HAD it, but it will be how I always have it.  This was absolutely delicious.

I was craving french toast tonite after reading another review, and searched for one that sounded good without being lots of trouble (or overnight).  I'm so glad I found this one.

Absolutely delicious."
549460,378,3/4/2008,5,This makes the best french toast ever.  I have never been able to make good french toast until now.
873008,378,2/6/2010,5,"Fantastic and easy!!  I always have ""lost bread,"" sometimes a little too much.  Thanks so much for the recipe."
1648730,378,7/15/2010,5,"My husband and I tried this recipe for breakfast this morning.  We often have leftover Hawaiian bread from communion each Sunday, so I used that for the bread.  It really did not need syrup at all - but we used some! Yum!"
2001028303,378,9/22/2018,5,I'm from New Orleans and My Mawmaw used to make this for us every weekend. Brings back great memories.
43642,378,8/16/2004,5,"I was about to do some experimenting myself with salmon and Liquid Smoke when I ran across this recipe. This is so easy to make, and it does really taste great.  I used the maximum amount of Liquid Smoke listed.  After the second refrigeration, I skinned and boned the salmon, which was super-easy.  When I tasted it, I thought it was good but I wanted it smokier - so I added probably another 2 Tablespoons of Liquid Smoke and refrigerated it a couple more hours.  I thought it was perfect then.  I used some to make a salmon pasta dish (I will post the recipe - it was GOOD!), and the rest went in the freezer for later.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe - it was just what I was looking for!"
718620,378,7/25/2010,5,"really yummy waffles - i didn't have orange zest, and i'm not a fan of nuts, so i omitted both, and they still turned out wonderful.  A definite keeper.  thanks"
1169601,378,2/14/2009,5,"I've made a recipe very similar to this for years.  It was in the Better Homes and Gardens Summertime Grilling cookbook.  I misplaced my copy, and found this one called Bean Quartet as well.  Any way, I have started just putting it in a crock pot and slow cooking in while I am preparing the rest of my food.  It is always a crowd pleaser, and very easy to make.  

Note - the 1 ounce cans is obviously a mistake.  My recipe had one 15 ounce can of each of the beans except the pork and beans.  That was 22 ounces or so."
158446,378,12/16/2007,3,"The combination of the banana with the caramel was great.  This took much longer than stated in the recipe to bake though.  The glaze was too much, so I reserved some & poured it over each slice to serve."
1138230,378,3/17/2012,5,"You may not have given credit to Southern Living which is where I got this recipe. It came out in 1998 sometime. However, thanks for posting it. I didn't have time to let the cake cool completely so the caramel sauce basically soaked in to the warm cake which was delicious. Took it to a baby shower & everyone wanted the recipe. I also didn't have shortening so used all butter & I added a second banana for even more flavor.  Not only yummy, but it's a great use for overripe bananas!"
1800095597,378,10/2/2013,5,"I don&#039;t even like bananas but my family does. I made this cake for them and it got rave reviews! My husband, father, &amp; sons have all requested (demanded, really!) that I make it for Thanksgiving, if not sooner. This recipe is a keeper!!!"
23119,378,9/23/2009,5,Wonderful fish!!!!!!!!!!!Will be making these again. Easy and tasty. Made for PAC.
1623265,378,3/28/2014,3,This was good but for some reason my breading fell off while frying it.
156034,379,7/3/2007,4,"Tried this for ZWT III and it was very good.

It is much better warm, but DH did take the rest of it to work with him the next day and the guys really enjoyed it.

Thanks Chilicat....it is a good, quick recipe to make and we liked it."
220166,379,7/8/2007,4,I am not big on sweet cornbread but this was good.  I have never made cornbread with bisquick and I was kinda leary but it turned out really good.  I liked the texture it had.  It isn't a cornbread I would serve with beans but I will make it again.  Thanks chilicat!
41578,379,7/20/2009,5,"What a perfect way to start the day.  The eggs turned out light and fluffy.  I served this with a bowl of fresh fruit.  This would also be a great dish to serve to guests.  Thanks for sharing, Bobbie #3!!!"
381180,379,5/3/2010,5,"GREAT QUICHE!  I had it for breakfast this morning and it reheated quickly in the microwave for dinner tonight!  I used 1/4 tsp red pepper because I was totally out of black pepper ~ I had only 1/4 cup mozzarella, so I added 4-ounces of minced Swiss and also added 1 T dried chives.  Made for Andi's MAY FARM COOKING in the Photo forum."
1967997,379,12/24/2011,5,"My family didn't care too awfully much for it, but I didn't mind, because this was beautiful and smelled amazing!!  I don't eat the main ingredients in this due to stomach problems, but if I had, I KNOW it would have been 100% perfect!  So, bravoooooo on an amazing and easy (wow-don't get that combo often!) meal!  Served with mini blueberry waffles from my new waffle iron.<br/><br/>And K-U-W, beautiful picture!!!"
2437861,379,10/8/2012,0,"made this for Brunch--added green peppers . It turned out beautifully and was very good.Going to add mushrooms,sausage and onion next time. Hubby really liked it. Thanks for sharing."
353789,379,6/3/2018,5,"Not only is this the easiest quiche; it's crowd-pleasing delicious. I slice the pie and freeze it. It's way better than a bowl of cereal weekday mornings. Because I typically buy x-large eggs, I use 3 eggs in this recipe. I also vary the cheeses. This is such a versatile recipe...I love it!"
268973,380,1/15/2007,5,"Wow, this is so yummy! It was really quick too.  I was a little scared of the red peppers, but all it did was add a little zip. This was absolutely fantastic. Thank you so much!"
187281,381,1/19/2007,5,Easy and sooo yummy! A great alternative to pizza!
562341,381,9/13/2007,5,"Quick and satisfying is right.  I loved this meal.  I added sliced mushrooms to mine as well.  It is really a blank slate in which you could add anything you wanted.  My husband and I were coming up with different ways to reinvent this recipe.  How about a chedder, turkey and bacon one.  Absolutely delicioius."
552807,381,11/2/2007,5,Great quick & simple recipe!  Thanks!
360127,381,12/8/2007,4,"Excellent. We have never had stromboli before, but it was great! The kids ate theirs all up without me harassing them (a rarity in our house). I am making it again this week. I couldn't find pre made pizza dough, so used #151791."
710496,381,1/9/2008,5,"This was fantastic and easy to make.  The roasted red peppers gave the stromboli a nice flavor.  Next time, I think I might put some mushrooms inside, or perhaps some sauteed onions.  The possibilities are endless!"
719929,381,2/1/2008,4,"DH loved it! That's saying a lot. Thank you for the recipe, will definitely use again sometime."
230860,383,3/4/2008,5,"This was fantastic!  So simple and a nice full flavor.  Maybe a touch too greasy from the pepperoni, but I just let it drip out and dabbed w/ paper towel to soak some up.  I also had to use regular pepperoni since that's all I could find.  Definately a keeper and probably quite versatile as well."
189475,384,12/8/2008,5,"This was SO good!  I messed up the first one by rolling the pizza dough in a ball and it wouldn't spread out into a pizza crust, but my friend used the messed up dough to make garlic knots and I learned an important lesson about how NOT to make a stromboli! Fortunately I had another thing of pizza dough and I used that one to make a very delicious stromboli. Thanks for the recipe."
646398,385,1/7/2009,5,"An awesome family friendly recipe!  After their first bite, my husband and 2 kids immediately requested this to be put into the regular dinner rotation.

Thanks for posting."
358544,387,2/16/2009,5,Very simple an delicious! Family enjoyed this a lot. Will be making again and maybe trying salami and ground sausage. Thank you.
1141377,387,1/25/2010,3,"I thought this was going be a ""go to"" meal, but it was extremely doughy.  My husband and I were so disappointed this didn't turn out.  Hopefully others have better luck.  Thanks for posting."
972900,393,3/15/2010,5,"We have made this 3 times in the last month - my husband raves about it! Today I made it in advance and put it in the fridge until dinner. My husband likes to slice pieces off of it and pan sear them - extra amazing! We put prosciutto, ham, salami, pepperoni, provolone cheese and mushrooms in ours. Very impressive and easy dinner - takes about 10 minutes to throw together!"
1034569,396,2/7/2011,5,This is so easy to make. I throw it together a lot for a quick lunch and heat up the leftovers during the week. In one of the reviews someone mentioned pan searing it and I found that to be an easy way to heat it up. You can do so much with this recipe.
290010,399,4/20/2013,4,"I made this as written except I omitted the peppers.  I liked it, but it is a bit salty for me."
619965,399,1/24/2008,5,"Really, really good. And very easy to make!  Thanks a lot."
207176,399,5/30/2007,0,My kids love carrot sticks with Ranch dressing as long as I don't give it too often!  I buy the bags of mini carrots already prepared so it's easy to throw them into a snack size ziplock bag.
64667,399,6/4/2007,4,"You know, I've packed carrot sticks in the kids' & hubby's lunches for years, just NEVER once thought to put in some DIP for 'em (not more than a few times, that is).   So, thanks for reminding me to do this.   We took some today on our little picnic, Ranch dressing for DD and Western dressing for moi!   Ymmyyy!~!!~

370332,400,12/10/2007,5,This was really good!  I added some ground beef and tripled the spices to serve as a main dish.  Thanks for the recipe!
329753,400,2/13/2011,5,"I was looking for something quick to cook with couscous, and let me tell you that this is DELICIOUS!  Fast, easy, and healthy.  I also added some cooked chicken and extra raisins, and feel very good about serving this.  Thank you soo much:)<br/>Kathy"
2001686985,400,8/25/2017,0,to make it more delicious add onion. Usually I steam the couscous
653438,400,3/19/2011,4,Made this for Spring PAC 2011 and it does have a kick.  Next time I might cut down on the red peppers but still overall it  was quite good.  I seasoned some shrimp that I had with the seasoning and grilled them for an appetizer.
2342357,401,7/26/2012,0,I like this season salt it help create many dishes
962690,402,7/17/2009,5,"The pastry for this is WONDERFUL.
I cut it in a 10 inch circle then made a smaller one.

Next time I will slice my apples a bit thinner so I can get more apple in. I was having a hard time folding the pasty over and having it tear only because my slices were a bit to thick.I didn't use all the toffee bits but should of so will next time LOL.
This was the perfect size to give us apple pie without alot of pie leftover.
Served with vanilla ice cream drizzled with caramel sauce.
PERFECT.
This is going in my Divine Cookbook.

Made for Everyday is a Holiday"
444132,402,8/16/2009,5,"Beautiful AND delicious!  I like that this is like a half sized pie, perfect for smaller families, like mine.  I used two apples, which I sliced thin, as wicked suggested - and I did use all the toffee chips, and I'm glad I did!  I suggest putting the apples on less than half of the circle, as you'll need a little more than half when you fold it over.  I think I will push the apples a little closer to the edges than I did (well, at least on the ends), because my ends were a little long - this is one recipe that will definately improve as I get better at working with pastry.  Thanks, WC, for a great recipe!  Made for PRMR Tag."
424680,404,5/16/2010,5,"What a great way to make just half a pie, especially when using fruit that doesn't end up with a lot of juice! Made this very tasty pie for just 2 of us, giving us a wonderful dessert & a bonus snack later on, but without a whole pie to finish off! My other half particularly enjoyed the inclusion of the toffee pieces! Thanks for sharing the recipe! [Tagged & made in Please Review My Recipe]"
1072593,404,10/13/2010,0,:-)))) That's me and my double (quadruple) chin.  These days I'm thinking turtle necks or maybe that should read turkey necks. :-/)))) Pretty darn good and made for A-NZ #45 Recipe Tag.
526666,407,12/2/2010,5,"OK, so I *cheated* a little, as I had a pie crust I needed to use. I'm certainly going to make this again and look forward to making the pastry from scratch, as this will certainly get even better! The toffee bits are very complimentary. It was easy to make, tho, perhaps due to my crust, I only needed 30 minutes, and maybe a couple less next time. I also used turbinado sugar for sprinkling on top. Just wonderful and super easy; great as a last minute dessert for the family. I did serve mine a la mode. Yum! Thanks for sharing, weekend cooker!"
50509,407,10/27/2011,4,"I also used a premade crust. Because it came in a roll, it was easy to cut in half and make two smaller pies, which was more practical for me. I misread the amount of toffee bits, so this was not sweet enough for me - even though my apple was a tart-sweet variety. The one thing that I did not like was that there was a bit too much crust on the edges - that might have been to my admittedly inept technique with pie crust. This is a great idea for a smaller pie for smaller households."
286566,408,2/16/2011,4,"We really liked the marinade but next time I would use fresh oregano and also add some fresh rosemary (we are fortunate that both grow abuntantly all year round and I did double the garlic as we just love the fresh garlic we have harvested).  I cooked on an indoor grill (using 12 loin chops for 4 which were served up with 2 recieving 4 and the other 2 persons got 2 each which suited us).  I cooked on an indoor electric ridged grill 5 minutes per side which gave a well done to the smaller chops and a slight pink to the larger ones so everyone got what they liked.  Thank you Sara 76, made for Bargain Basement."
1840822,408,2/27/2011,0,NOT an oreo lots of time to make and very disappointing
141980,409,5/6/2005,4,"Very simple and quick meal to throw together at the end of the day. Perfect for working moms and dads! We used low-fat rolls to lighten the recipe just a bit and it still tasted good. Next time, I would probably add some diced onion to give it a little more flavor. Thanks Branwyn!"
304590,411,8/28/2006,5,"This cheesecake is so light and fluffy! And unlike most recipes out there it only uses 2 packages of cream cheese!! I have made it without the pineapple and it is awesome too. I have also cut the recipe in half (except 3 eggs instead of 5) and prepare it in an 8in springform and it comes out great as well. I use the wide side foil to make sure that no water will leak in...sometimes if you have to overlap foil to cover the whole bottom, the water will still find a way in. I messed up one of these cheesecakes that way unfortunately. Try it today!!"
875616,411,7/28/2009,5,fanstatically light and delicious!
176615,412,3/2/2009,4,"Simple skillet meal that's good when the weather is cold. Creamy sauce covers chicken pices and hunks of potato and carrots. I used ""pick o the chick,"" which was more than 4 pounds of chicken, 5 medium potatoes, and a pound of baby carrots. Even so, there was plenty of sauce. For my tastes, I would reduce the fat next time, subbing half and half for whipping cream and reducing the butter at least by half. With butter, whipping cream, and fat from the chicken skin, I was feeling a bit guilty. Thanks for sharing the recipe!"
205786,412,3/3/2010,5,"Awesome. I did make some changes but the basics were the same and I loved the results. I wanted to make half the recipe, and did so, with the following exceptions. I used 3 egg yolks and 2 whites. I omitted the pineapple and juice, instead using the juice of one lemon. I made this in a 6"" springform pan which I buttered generously and sprinkled with graham crumbs (it took about 1/4 cup to coat the pan bottom and sides). I was worried that the pan was going to be too small but it worked perfectly. I wrapped the bottom of the pan in foil and set it in a larger pan with water about 3/4"" up the sides of the pan. I cooked it a 325ÂºF (my oven runs a little hot) and it took 70 minutes. This made 6 nice-size servings which I served with a strawberry sauce."
93843,412,7/13/2003,4,"The taste is nice, definitely like tomatoey stroganoff.  I think it probably tastes better the next day after it has had time to firm up a bit more."
125325,413,1/21/2006,4,This was really good and filling. My family really enjoyed this. The only change I made was to use minced garlic instead of garlic salt. Thank you!
143086,414,1/1/2007,5,"So glad I took a chance and requested this recipe on here...Just sorry it took me so long to post a review.  I made this within a week of getting the email, and it tasted even better than I remembered.   Miss Annie, thanks again so much for posting this."
545825,414,8/23/2007,5,"I've been making this lasagna for years.  It's definitely one of our favorites.  It is very filling, but makes enough for my husband to be able to take a slice with him for lunch the next day."
53373,414,9/26/2007,5,"My new ""standby"" lasagna recipe!  My family raves over it.  I sub low fat items and use turkey ground beef and turkey sausage and whole wheat noodles.  Soooo yummy!!
I add a little italian seasoning to the meat sauce and some parm chz during the laying process!!"
177933,414,10/19/2007,4,"I thought it was great, my husband thought it was too cream cheesy.  I made it for a friend that just had a baby, I am sure they enjoyed it.  Thanks!"
53932,414,2/17/2009,5,This is very good.  I deviated from the recipe a bit using my own meat sauce.  Loved the cream cheese/sour cream filling as a delightful change from ricotta!
623399,414,9/16/2009,5,"I first made this recipe out of my taste of home contest winning book.  It is DELICIOUS! I have made it several times and whenever I am in the mood for lasagna, this is the recipe that I go for.  I love the cream cheese mixture in this!  It makes it so creamy and unique.  LOVE IT!  I do normally season the sauce mixture real well with more spices and seasonings.  But other than that I stick to the recipe!  The best lasagna ever!  10 stars!!"
89831,414,7/12/2004,5,"Uncle Bill, I made your perogies over the weekend, and they were so good, I am giving your recipe more than 5 stars... actually I must say, the best dough that I have made so far, and I have tryed a lot of different pierogi dough recipes! I did not have a pierogi mini form, so I rolled out the dough by hand. I made the dough the night before, and used it the following day, I took it out of the fridge and let it sit on the counter at room temperature, that made for easier rolling. You didn't state where to add in the sour cream, so I just added it with the whipping cream, milk and eggs, I did however, used half and half instread of milk. I used my own filling recipe with fryed onions, sour cream and Cheeze Whiz...I am so happy that I decided to try your recipe they turned our absolutely wonderful. Although, it took me a half a day to make these, it was well worth the time and effort. Thanks so much for sharing such a winning recipe Uncle Bill. I look forward to making these again (the next time I will make them with saurkraut!).. , this method produces a wonderful soft dough, I highy advise anyone to try your recipe, thanks...Kittencal:)"
138429,414,11/15/2004,5,"What can I say . This deserves 10 out of 5. I always had a lady make up Perogies for me but after seeing the great detailed instructions, decided to try this recipe. I will make my own perogies from here on in. I followed the recipe and will never change a thing. Thank you so much for the recipe and detailed instructions. "
199839,414,6/14/2007,3,Great!!
806741,414,10/26/2008,5,Fantastic. I made the recipe as prescribed. I had made a Thai butternut squash soup and beef stew with mashed potatoes the day before. I used both of these for filling (of course not together) they turned out amazing. I froze them. The real test will be when my Lithuanian friend is over for dinner. I will try to report back on her opinion!
713867,414,5/4/2010,5,"Uncle Bill, your recipes are amazing!  I made perogies using your dough (instead of my Mennonite grandmother's) and the cottage cheese filling we've always used (just like yours).  Sooooooooo good!  We've always served our ""cheesepockets"" with sour cream and onions fried in lots of butter.  My niece and nephew have been known to eat them to the point of groans and immobility!  Thanks again for all your wonderful recipes."
1445414,414,6/16/2010,3,"I have been making perogies since I could walk. My mom had me in the kitchen rolling dough and mashing potatoes. This is the nicest dough I have worked with in those many years. The dough is best worked if left to sit for an hour or so after making. My friends and family get together at least once a year to make anywhere from 500 to 2000 perogies and then freeze them. They freeze remarkably well. I am however, only giving the dough 3 stars because it is quite high in fat and once you add all the fixings the meal becomes a quadruple bypass waiting to happen. next time I think I am going to try the recipe with a few substitutions i.e the milk, cream and sour cream and see how it goes."
524381,414,1/18/2008,5,"This was so delicious!  Very easy and very flavorful!  Really a refreshing change from the baked turkey I normally do!  I don't know if it was a scale issue (I scaled up 3X), but there was a considerable amount of excess broth at the end.  I just turned up the heat and boiled it off and it was fine.  And it was so pretty with the white rice, red tomatos and green spinach; I would serve this for company!  Thank you, Bec!!"
221810,414,10/20/2008,5,"Very Yummy! I used half a pound of ground turkey, brown rice, and frozen spinach. I ended up having to double the broth because of the brown rice, and I didn't have any tomatoes, so I just threw in diced fresh mushrooms instead. Being diabetic, it was perfect for me. I know it says ""for  2"" but I'm gonna end up scarfing it all myself! Thanks for the yummy, healthy lunch, Bec!"
440324,414,11/19/2011,5,"Delicious! I used brown rice and arugula instead of spinach. It looked very appetizing and the tasted even better. To me, this is the ultimate weeknight meal. Thank you."
583809,414,2/14/2015,5,"An easy and nutritious meal!  I used ground turkey, frozen spinach, and spaghetti sauce.  Fabulous one dish supper."
220348,414,4/14/2012,5,"This was so delicious! First of all, I used a combination of dried apricots, dates, raisins and dried cranberries for the dried fruits. For the macaroons, I used chocolate because I love chocolate, and I've always found that apricots and raisins go well with chocolate, and in this case, it's also true. The cinnamon and cloves just add to the sweetness of the macaroon compote, which is just fine with me! Sadly, though, I cannot tell you if this refrigerates well overnight, because it never lasted that long, which is fine, because I plan to make more! :)"
131126,414,6/20/2006,5,"I liked this one and thought the curry powder worked well on butternut squash.  I used Femmes' Revenge Caribbean Curry Mix Recipe #158082 I also didn't bother with threading on skewers.  I served right out of the oven.  Thanks Sharon!!! 
"
67656,414,6/24/2006,4,"These were quite good. I replaced the butter with olive oil (same fat but less cholesterol), and reduced it to about 2 tablespoons. Also added a bit  (1/2 teaspoon maybe) of garam masala. Really liked the way the spices contrasted with the natural sweetness of the squash. These would be a great way to get some veggies on the menu at a party dominated by finger foods. I think next time I might include sweet onions and red peppers to add a little more dimension and color to the dish. Thanks Sharon."
211184,414,6/26/2006,5,I really liked this. The curry/butter sauce was just right with the squash. Thanks for posting. Nick's Mom
112818,418,2/9/2007,0,"I did not like the taste of this recipe. I feel that it is lacking other ingredients. I would omit the chili sauce and replace it with ketchup, and the dill pickles would have to go. Of course, omitting those two ingredients makes it a completely different recipe with other ingredients."
171063,422,12/29/2006,5,"I made this one night after dinner for my family, and it has a refreshingly fruity taste and was easy to make.  Thanks for this fun recipe."
336058,423,2/3/2007,4,"I used all w.w. pastry flour, margarine, and frozen blueberries.  I never have good luck with my waffle maker!  The first few came out great, but then they started falling apart when I took them out.  I think I'll make them as pancakes.  I put butter and cinnamon/sugar on them and I couldn't taste the blueberries.  Might have been the all w.w. and frozen berries.  Next time will try with fresh (if I can afford organic).  Will try the orange zest next time (didn't have organic orange.)"
64642,423,6/11/2008,5,"These were just wonderful and so easy to make.  Followed the recipe as written and had no problems with it at all.  To stop the waffles from sticking, I give the waffle iron a little spritz of cooking spray between waffles."
279989,424,8/25/2008,4,These were a really good meal.  I fixed them for our family for brunch over the weekend.  I used frozen blueberries and omitted the pecans and orange zest because we didn't have any but I'm sure these are wonderful with them.  This was our first experience at using wheat flour in our waffles and we all agreed they were wonderful with it.  I had no trouble with them sticking to my waffle iron or falling apart.  Thanks for sharing.
128473,428,4/8/2010,5,"Now these were some good waffles.  Really flavorful with great texture.  These big tall treats were crisp on the outside and tender inside, just bursting with flavor. I love the addition of the orange zest to the pancakes.  I made these exactly as written and didn't have any problems.  Thanks so much Calee for sharing this tasty treat.  Made for my Pac baby. :)"
2000151138,429,4/19/2015,5,These are amazing!
705251,429,6/28/2012,5,This is an excellent recipe for blueberry waffles.  I was looking for a recipe that included whole wheat and you've hit the mark with this gem.  The waffles had a great texture to them and packed full of flavor.  I think the next time I may exclude the nuts and add some cinnamon and/or nutmeg for a little twist.  I doubled the recipe so I could have some frozen for future breakfasts.  Thanks for sharing!
2000206708,429,5/16/2015,5,"I doubled the blueberries, added a micro splash of almond extract, and subbed ev coconut oil for the butter.  They&#039;re fabulous!!   I remembered the egg white trick.  My brother taught me that a long time ago.  It makes them special somehow, more crisp."
270370,429,1/20/2009,5,"My Italian stepfather used to make these and i have been dying to figure out how to do them since he is gone now.  Wow, yummy, and so much thanks for the recipe:)"
481092,431,11/9/2007,5,"This was a nice change of pace from Italian sausage and tomato sauce.  I wasn't sure what a ""sun blushed tomato"" was so I used three roma tomatoes diced.    I liked it more than my husband, but since I'm the poster, hee hee, I gladly give this five stars."
930100,431,9/5/2008,4,This was really good but a little too spicy for me. When I make this again I think I might try leaving out the red pepper flakes.
601528,431,10/1/2008,4,Wooo is this spicy! I didn't have fresh tomatoes on hand so I used a can of drained diced tomatoes and that worked out just fine. Very good and we will be making it again.
58104,431,2/23/2009,5,"This is rich, deep and delish. I sliced sweet onions thinly in half circles. Roasted garlic is a must! For the tomatoes I used Recipe #57884. 
Thanks!!!"
1197511,431,7/24/2009,5,"I made this dish a few days ago. I followed the recipe almost exactly (maybe added a little extra garlic - I tend to). My girlfriend and I loved this dish, and I'm making it again tonight for some friends. I used grocery-shelf ingredients (red cooking wine, sausage, sun-blushed tomatoes from a jar, etc.), and it turned out wonderfully. Very highly recommended!"
1639045,432,6/22/2010,4,I loved this recipe... was very tasteful. i removed the casings from the sausage though and pan fried it with onions some garlic and chili pepper flakes!! Was awesome even my 7 year old daughter loved it.
411045,432,11/5/2010,0,"I am not going to rate this, since I had to make quite a few changes, but what I did was delicious.  First of all I used the ground chorizo, since it was what I had.  I did not have garlic cloves, so I used garlic powder.  I used a can of undrained diced tomatoes and in place of the red wine, I used beef broth.  It was very good having made these changes, even my 2 yo really liked it.  I will make it again.  Maybe I will be able to make it the way it is written!"
1427444,432,11/25/2010,4,"This turned out sooo good! made a few changes though,used 2 400g tins diced Italian tomatos, 4 chirizos and 5 cloves garic(love the stuff) also used 500g of penne pasta as i made it for 5 people.will definately make this again ,thanks for a lovely recipe :)"
1877783,432,4/8/2011,0,Sticking to this recipe brings out the best result. Have cooked variations in the past using just a few ingrediants however the addition of red wine adds another layer to this dish. The fragrant Chorizo if bought from a good deli will really be the boss on the plate. Sensational.
437727,432,3/2/2012,5,"This is 100% KICK BUTT AWESOME!! I was debating between this and another recipe, chose this one.... and SO glad I did! Unfortunately, I didn't have any sun-blushed tomatoes, so I used some home oven-dried ones that I reconstituted in the microwave. Added the tomato water with the tomatoes. EXCELLENT!!... (and don't skip the step of roasting the garlic, it adds so much dimension to this dish!!"
2574795,432,12/4/2016,4,"Didn't have sun-blushed tomatoes so used canned diced (long way to town for us). Otherwise followed closely. I liked the spice but it was a bit much for my wife. If we make again, I will probably leave out the dried chili pepper flakes and let each person add their own."
421546,432,2/29/2008,5,"This is a delicious and decadent pudding.  The straining and blending make it lusciously smooth and creamy, something I probably should have been doing to all my puddings over the years.  This is just the ticket to satisfying my chocoholic husband.  Thank you for posting!"
59879,432,2/24/2012,4,A really great weeknight dinner that is quick and tasty!  Have made several times and didn't realize that it was on here so I could rate.
53932,432,7/25/2009,4,So simple to prepare and very good.
46196475,432,4/25/2015,5,"Excellent recipe. Didn&#039;t change a thing.
A perfect French bread."
1060485,432,4/28/2009,2,very bland.
247152,432,5/27/2009,5,"This was even better than expected, especially since I had to do a change of plans at the last second. I was just starting to make this when I realized that I was out of long-grain white rice so I ended up using minute rice and following the microwave instructions (I know, gasp!)... but it honestly turned out really nice! In fact I would make this again as an easy Mexican side dish. I left out the Cajun seasoning and served this with chicken and cheese enchiladas tonight. Thanks for a great recipe! I think I'll probably make this again exactly the same or even in my rice cooker once I re-stock my rice supply :) Made for ZWT5."
323186,432,6/5/2009,5,"Easy to prepare,  I made this quickly last night to accompany a light chicken curry, we enjoyed it very much, good flavour and a good texture.  I omitted the cajun seasoning this time, but will try adding it next time, depending on what I'm serving it with, I'm sure it'll be delicious!

Good recipe, thank you Vicki!

Made for ZWT5"
331557,432,8/5/2009,5,"This rice is great and especially great for a change from white.  I followed the recipe as written the first time and it turned out great.  The second time I used the rice cooker - just threw all ingredients in the pot at the same time and let it go.  It was still tasty, although, oddly enough, spicier.  Thanks for posting a keeper!"
764068,432,9/10/2009,5,Awesome rice! The smokiness of the cumin is wonderful. The only thing I changed was that I made it in the rice cooker instead as CYAOS mentioned. Could not have been easier to make and it was done in no time. Thank you for posting Vicki!!!
213139,432,4/19/2010,4,"This was good, but we didn't feel that it was very spicy and the lime flavor could have been a little stronger.  Will definitely make this again and adjust the spices and lime juice to our likings.  Made for Spring 2010 PAC."
226145,432,5/9/2011,5,Loved it!  Made with the cajun seasoning and it wasn't too spicy.  Will be a favorite from now on.  Thanks for posting PianoCook!
1404497,432,10/4/2009,4,The London Broil was so tender it was falling apart.  The potatoes and carrots stayed firm.  Delicious!
1398656,432,12/26/2013,5,"Great easy way to cook London Broil. Very tender and tasty. I make my own onion soup mix, (the recipe is here on Food.com), to reduce the salt."
1803152032,432,9/20/2014,0,How do u make your own soup mix???
2000211886,432,5/19/2015,1,"What a WASTE of good ingredients. I should have known from the lack of seasonings that the meat would be tasteless, but it was also completely dried out - something I never thought could happen when cooking in that much liquid. One of the WORST crock pot dishes I&#039;ve ever had and definitely the worst London Broil I&#039;ve ever made. I&#039;ll stick to grilling it from now on."
1667251,432,1/22/2016,2,I should have realised that the lack of additional seasonings would make this bland.  The house did not smell like anything was cooking.  A waste of an expensive piece of meat.
2001081653,432,7/9/2016,4,"I found this to be a good recipe. And I must point out to some novices that slammed this recipe: unless the recipe is for a bakery item, it gives you the basics. The blank foundation and leaves the seasoning up to. So, if you make this, you add the type and quantity of seasonings you want. Play with the recipe such as browning the near and using some red wine as part of the liquids. Add a splash of steak sauce or a dash of Italian seasoning with salt and pepper. Use baby red potatoes or try parsnips or yucca. It's up to you."
131349,432,12/16/2009,4,"I used the dipping sauce and it is delicious, I used dry onion soup that you can buy in packages, 1/4 cup mayo vs the 1/2 cup and 1/4 cup ranch dressing. The mayo or dressing can be a little over powering so add carefully. This is a great recipe. thanks
Chris"
136997,432,1/19/2010,5,"Delicious. I didn't have the Fusilli on hand, so used Ziti. I added the suggested Parmesan and lemon zest. Made for New Kids on the Block Tag. :)"
47892,432,2/10/2010,4,Easy yet elegant dish. I accidentally purchased penne and not fusilli but at least it was the correct pasta shape for this recipe. (Confused myself looking at Lori Mama's photo.) I felt the dish were missing something and I added a pinch of freshly grated nutmeg to the cream sauce. A light sprinkle of Greek myzithra and the lemon zest  on top made for a very delicious and quick meal. Reviewed for Veg Swap #19-2010. Thanks!
424680,432,3/8/2010,5,"Made these GREAT TASTING BARS to take to an art class & share with the students, & to make them a little less overpowering with calories, I cut the finished pan into 16 smaller bars (15 students & the instructor, so . . .)! Very warmly received & acclaimed ~ Thanks for sharing the recipe! [Made & reviewed in New Kids on the Block tag]"
1633475,432,6/14/2010,5,"This is absolutely fantastic.  I used boneless skinless chicken thighs, and it was the most flavorful, tender chicken ever.  The gravy was a huge hit with the family.  We love spicy food, but if you don't you can use less chipotle.  I can't wait to make this again!"
178427,432,10/11/2011,5,This is fabulous! I made it as directed. It was made for a birthday party and everyone just loved it. I'll definitely make this again. Thanks for sharing. Made for PAC Fall 2011.
2001002847,432,1/2/2017,5,"I love this recipe but usually find that the first phase has some trouble with the flour:water ratio (usually ends up being too sticky, even for French bread). Can someone please post ingredient weights? I always prefer to weigh vs scoop, so would greatly appreciate any insight. Thanks."
2001805186,432,11/19/2017,5,"Awesome!!! It took longer then I planned, however not bad for my first time making any bread. Can’t wait to make pizza subs with it. If I only had made my homemade wine prior. Delicious bread!!! Thank you for this recipe."
2001935821,432,1/16/2018,5,"I use the bread machine for French bread, then turn off the machine before the last rise. I use the mixing order (put salt in last)and shaping methods by Danielle Foresterie. Look like the real McCoy and taste delicious."
384918,432,3/29/2013,5,"Actually I forgot to add the oil, so the mixture seemed pretty dry.  I added an egg (instead of re-reading the recipe, duh) and they turned out pretty yummy!  I gave it 5 stars because they are yummy even when I goofed up.  Next time I will try with the oil  :)"
1802793382,432,6/3/2014,5,This was a very easy recipe to follow and surprisingly tastey!
2001977923,432,2/6/2018,5,"Turned out great. I added a tablespoon of sugarless chocolate. I used coconut oil since it was all that I had. Added 3/4 cup dried sugarless cranberries and 1/4 cup dried cherries. It was fine with only two medium bananas. Because the fruit had such little sugar in it, I added 2 tablespoons of sugar."
2002138361,432,5/2/2018,5,"I don't normally make comments but these cookies turned out really well and the ingredients were not overly complicated or expensive. I made a few tweaks because I was out of vegetable oil so instead I used vegan becel, and added 3 heaping tablespoons of brown sugar, and doubled the amount of cinnamon. I forgot to let the mixture sit for 15 minutes prior to baking, but when I made a second batch (because they are so good) I didnt notice a difference between the cookies, so if you are in a hurry or you forget its nbd."
226863,432,3/1/2013,4,"This recipe makes a lot of sauce to go with the meat.  I really wanted mashed potatoes so served this over mashed potatoes instead of over the rice.  This turned out a bit sweet, so I think I'd half the amount of Pepsi and ketchup next time.  I'll also simmer a bit longer to allow the meat to get a bit more tender.  Overall, this tasted very good.  Thanks for posting, and good luck in the contest!"
131126,432,3/2/2013,5,"I adapted the recipe to fit my day. The steak was breaded and fried early in the day and then set aside. Later that evening, the steak was placed in a foil lined pan sauce,  veggies were added, and the recipe baked uncovered for 50 minutes on 350 oven.  We found the steak was still fairly tough and it would have benefited for a longer cook time.  There was still loads of sauce and the recipe had enough onions and peppers.  The sauce thickened, has notes of celery seed, and a nice hint of tart from the ponzu. The meal was served with mixed colors of fingerling potatoes, garlic bread, and a green salad.  I wish I had followed the instructions though & stuck with the suggested rice.  I saved the leftover sauce to serve over potatoes later in the week.  <br/>Next time? I would use tenderized round for frying & increase the baking time.  Good luck in the contest!"
128473,432,7/15/2013,5,"I really enjoyed the eggs prepared this way morgainegeiser.  It was quick and really easy with fantastic results.  The eggs were perfectly cooked and had a wonderful texture and flavor.  Thank you for sharing your recipe, it made for a delicious breakfast.  Made for ZWT9."
328048,432,7/17/2013,0,Easy and delicious. I cooked my eggs 20 minutes to get them cooked through. Great flavor. The feta adds a nice touch.
1226388,432,7/18/2013,5,"This was really great!  It was delicious, and fast and easy enough to be a quick weekday breakfast, and luxurious enough for a lazy weekend.  It was really tasty just as it was posted, and I would like to try it next time with some additions like sauteed veggies, or even some bacon.  Made for ZWT9"
199105,432,10/8/2006,5,I've made this several times and it never fails to impress!
133174,432,7/19/2013,5,Made this for DH&#039;s breakfast this morning.  The butter was placed in the ramekin which was put into the oven while it preheated.  After butter melted the eggs were broken and placed into the ramekin then sprinkled with the feta.  Freshly ground black pepper was sprinkled over all.  The eggs required about an additional 4 minutes to cook to DH&#039;s liking.  This was served with butter toast.  Made for ZWT9.
383346,432,7/23/2013,5,I baked them 12 minutes.  The white were cooked but the yolks were still runny.  It was great.  Thanks morgainegeiser :)  Made for ZWT 9
174096,432,7/27/2013,5,"Yum, love this variation - the feta cheese really added a lot of great flavor.  I cooked about 12 minutes.  Thanks for sharing!  ZWT9"
286566,432,8/12/2013,5,"Delicious though I did have an oops moment in that the timer did not go off so my eggs ended up cooked more than I would have liked but still the flavours were great.  Thank you morgaingeiser, made for Aussie/Kiwi Recipe Swap #79 August 2013."
480195,432,8/27/2013,5,"This is a delicious way to serve eggs. My oven must run hot, because they were done in 10 minutes. I served them with sliced tomatoes, fresh from the garden. A wonderful breakfast. Thanks for sharing the recipe."

200862,432,4/17/2005,0,"As a South African, this is not the recipe I'd use again for my beloved morning rusks-and-sweet-tea. The baking powder is not enough for a good rise and the sugar used is too little -- rusks should have a definite sweetness for that early morning lift! I'd also use more butter next time. (Rusks are not a diet food -- enough sugar and butter are musts!) Otherwise, it's okay."
398101,434,12/1/2006,5,"this rusk recipe is to die for delicious!! i am south african and  have been looking or a recipe this ggod for ages.
thank you!!"
776892,434,2/27/2008,0,Recipe is not how I remember making rusks and it did not turn out how I remember. Too flat and not flavorful
1644688,435,7/2/2010,5,"These rusks were lovely, after reading the other reviews I did make some changes, because I am a lazy cook, I used five cups of self raising flour instead of the flour and baking powder in the recipe. 1 1/4 cups brown sugar, 1 tsp salt and 500ml buttermilk, the rest was as is. All the other rusk recipes I have seen and used called for 250 to 500gr butter, so this was perfect for a low fat treat. I will be making another batch this weekend, Because it was very gooey, I will try pouring the mixture into a baking dish and then cut up before drying out. will let you know how it works. thank you."
2399072,435,9/17/2012,5,"This recipe is just what I have been looking for.  It most closely matches the rusks we had in SA.  We had them mostly while on safari, but we also found them in the supermarkets (Super Spar) around SA.  I just made my first batch and they came out just as I remember them, hard as rocks with flavor, ready for dipping.  This is definitely a keeper. I love them."
2657556,436,1/26/2013,0,I really liked this recipe because of the low sugar and butter content. They were crunchy and delicious and I will be making them again.
1803556002,436,12/24/2014,5,"I grew up eating Ouma&#039;s Rusks, and these taste almost exactly the way I remember them.&lt;br/&gt;When I was making them, I mis-wrote the recipe down and used brown sugar instead of castor sugar, and they still came out beautifully.&lt;br/&gt;I definitely will be making these again for my South African mum."
196455,436,2/18/2005,5,Wow!  I recently had a pistachio biscotti at a local coffee house and loved it.  I came to the zaar to find a recipe and thought that I'd start here.  No need to look further!  Clear Directions and a product that is superior to most other biscotti that I've had.  Pefect amount of pistachios and sugar...and the lemon zest really rounds it out.  Thanks!!
178077,436,5/8/2005,5,"My first attempt and everyone loved it.  I dipped mine in melted chocolate on one side, once completely cooled.  
I also used 1/2 cup pistachios and 1/2 cup sliced almonds."
119621,436,5/10/2005,5,Excellent outcome! Very crunchy.
262830,436,1/23/2008,5,"Oh my goodness, this was an excellent recipe.  I couldn't find shelled pistachios so I bought ones in the shells and shelled them.  They worked just fine.  I took it to work and everybody drooled over it. Thanks for a great recipe."
766166,437,2/15/2008,5,"This is a great recipe!  The biscotti turned out beautifully. I made 2 small logs instead of one big one so that I could get more cookies. I've been making them weekly and have enjoyed dunking them in my coffee, tea, and milk. Thanks for posting."
1012944,441,11/3/2008,0,"This is beyond excellent.  I didn't have a ""log""pan so I tried a loaf pan...big mistake.  I took it out, then kind of re-shaped it and cooked it again on a cookie sheet.  Baking times were a lot longer and I think might be longer than recipe states anyway.  However, finished product was so worth it.  I used raw pistachios, unsalted and unroasted.  Seriously a 5 star recipe."
866668,444,11/9/2008,5,"These biscotti are great!  I've made them a few times, replacing the butter with more oil and the zest with a little lemon extract.   I prefer making two logs for smaller cookies, rolling them out with more flour to make them easier to handle."
37449,444,12/28/2008,5,"5 stars for taste! I made these as a gift for my DIL, who loves biscotti. I had a challenge forming them and added more flour. They didn't look so great, but tasted wonderful. I added some craisins to make them more Christmasy! Thanks!"
1489711,445,12/19/2009,5,This recipe was awesome! I did it just as said and it turned out great. Everyone loved it!
1991590,445,5/11/2018,5,Awesome recipe. Made it vegan with egg replacer and coconut shortening. Squeezed a touch of fresh lemon over biscotti after final bake.
21443,445,10/10/2005,5,These were to die for!!!  Even my husband who hates pumpkin liked them ( I didn't tell him what was in them until after he ate 3 of them!)  I used white and chocolate swirl chips instead of all chocolate...I also under baked them a bit to keep them soft and chewy...Thanks for this wonderful recipe...I will making it often!!
149420,445,10/18/2005,5,These are the best cookies with pumpkin Ive ever tasted.. I made a mistake the first time and put in a whole can of pumpkin and they were still great.. Definitely a winner..
234666,445,11/3/2005,5,Delicious!  This is my new favorite cookie.  They baked up light and fluffy with a hint of pumpkin.  I ommitted the nutmeg.  My 4-year-old daughter loved them too!
140806,445,11/22/2005,5,Yum! Made these from a leftover can of pumpkin and couldn't be more pleased! Not to sweet. Great with semi-sweet chocolate chips. I added a little more flour than called for and next time I will use a little less nutmeg. Thanks!
151547,445,4/2/2006,4,"Moist and fluffy with a cake-like texture, this cookie is a welcome change from the usual. "
212391,445,11/1/2006,5,"holy CRAP!  these are soooooo good and even better than i expected.  even my husband, who was skeptical at the combo of pumpkin and chocolate, liked them.  i usually prefer crunchy, not soft cookies, but these were awesome.  only thing i did different was i used sucanat instead of sugar and about 3/4 t. nutmeg.  oh yeah, and more chocolate!!  thanks ellie!"
173314,445,11/6/2006,5,Excellent and kids loved it and didnt even realize they got a healthy dose of vitamin a!  Thankyou...did halve the nutmeg and used milk chocolate chips.
652506,445,11/18/2007,4,These cookies were great!  I even used real pumpkin from our garden.  I used two full cups of it (cooked and pureed) as oppose to one can from the store.  Very light and fluffy cookies.  I will definitely be making these again.
306106,445,3/9/2008,4,"Only a 4 because they just aren't pretty cookies. They definitely are ADDICTIVE, though, and I am not usually one for sweets! I made the recipe exactly as directed (they ARE a bit sticky, can't imagine putting them through a press, although I don't have one...) and I did add the chips and nuts. YUM! Thanks so much, Ellie! :-)"
471896,445,4/23/2008,4,"These are really good.  I made them for the DH's poker night and they vanished.  I did have to add 10 minutes to the baking time, so watch them closely.  The time will vary depending on your oven."
61796,445,10/16/2008,4,"These are delicious cookies.  I had to add 6 minutes to the baking time.  They weren't quite as bright and pumpkiny as I was hoping, I'm trying to find something similar to cookies I got at a bakery in College.  Oddly enough, I thought they tasted much better when cold the next day."
74652,445,11/2/2003,5,This is my favorite way to eat yellow squash too! A real southern classic. So easy and delicious! Thanks for sharing!  :)
1230562,445,10/12/2010,0,"Yum! I made these for a church bake sale. They are easy to put together, and I always have these ingredients on hand. They are wonderful fresh from the oven, but they taste great once they've cooled too. I followed the recipe exactly (except I halved the nutmeg b/c I don't like it so strong) and did not use nuts or raisins. I used a 2 oz coffee scoop to form my cookies and they were perfectly cooked in 14 minutes. The only issue I have is that it doesnt taste as pumpkin-y as I'd hoped, so I'll probably add another 1/2 c of pumpkin next time and see if that flavor can come through a little more. Thanks for the recipe tho, I'm sure they'll be a big hit at the bake sale."
318262,445,12/2/2010,5,Wow these were delicious! And the batter was really really good too - almost better than the cookies :) I used Libby's pumpkin pie mix so I didn't include the spices because it was already spiced. Worked out perfectly!
591035,445,10/16/2011,4,"they are best fresh - even a half of a day later they loose any of that baked crunchy outside and become uniformly soft. but, when you have that in mind, they are delicious. i can taste the pumpkin. i might alter it to have more spices."
1384367,445,2/2/2015,5,"These are super-delicious (and soft!) cookies. My kids ate so many of them. I didn&#039;t use chocolate chips, though -- just raisins. These will definitely be made again and again in this house."
227652,445,3/19/2016,4,"I made these for a friend who loves pumpkin. After reading the reviews, I upped the pumpkin to 1 1/2 cups (made a very moist cookie), and used 1 1/2 tsp pumpkin pie spice instead of the cinnamon &amp; nutmeg. I baked for 12 minutes but am thinking 11 min would have been better. And I didn&#039;t use raisins or nuts. Thanks for sharing!"
2000533648,445,11/26/2016,5,These are very good cookies. I used white chocolate chips and the whole family loved them. It's a soft cookie with a light pumpkin taste. I threw out my old recipe and will be using this one from now on.
239808,445,6/6/2006,5,"I really enjoyed this, but did increase the volume of garlic quite a bit (sorry to anyone sitting near me today...) I also added a bit of fresh oregano that needed using. I served ot with a rice dish, but next time I'll go for just crusty bread"
65197,445,6/12/2006,5,"I love marinated mushrooms!  I've never made them with the tomato base before, these are great!
"
37449,445,6/12/2006,5,"This tasted really good! I used less tomatoes, more mushrooms. Instead of tomato paste I used ketchup. I had rather large mushrooms so I sliced them, thickly. Loved it! Thanks Di!"
28729,445,6/13/2006,5,"Great combination, mushrooms, tomatoes, wine and garlic. Yummy. Thanks for an awesome pasta dish"
107135,445,7/10/2006,5,good stuff dee
297076,445,9/15/2006,5,"These were simply amazing! Due to what we had, we used white wine and tomato sauce... didn't matter. I think I'll be hounding Tom to make these again and again. YUMMY!"
150281,445,6/5/2007,5,"This was lovely! Made a great pasta dinner and something my family really enjoyed. A great menu option for my fresh summer tomatoes and I love mushrooms, so what could be nicer!
Added a little more garlic, other than that made as directed.
ZWT3"
278516,445,9/18/2007,4,"Mmm mmm.
After it'd finished cooking i just put some couscous in the pan, put the lid on & let the juices soak in.
It was unattractive, but easy & tasty.
Served as a side.
I've made it before & I'll make it again. :)"
189280,445,4/21/2008,5,"Excellent flavors! I will definitely be making these again. I actually used canned tomatoes, white wine and I used cinnamon sugar, since I usually add a pinch of sugar to tomatoes. I cooked the liquid out and served over couscous. I love it! Thanks for posting. Made for Herb/Spice of the Month."
80353,445,5/28/2007,5,"Made this up as a snack for DH and myself today.  Spanish Bruschetta.  Loved the ease and the flavour - the presentation was very nice, too.  Good with some cold white wine."
527607,445,10/2/2007,5,"Just superb. One of those recipes where the simplicity and freshness of the ingredients make a feast for the tastebuds.

Thank you so much for posting this FT.

Made for photo tag in the games forum"
41767,445,2/27/2008,5,"Yum!  I served these at a Spanish-themed book club discussion last night along with sangria and a variety of other tapas.  They were a hit.  I couldn't find serrano ham, so I used prosciutto instead.  Thank you, French Tart, for such an easy and good recipe."
552613,445,5/12/2009,5,"Gracias for treating me to such a natural and simple dish for my lunch today.  I used vine tomatoes , Spanish olive oil and Serrano ham to really make me feel like I was having my lunch in Spain instead of slightly chilly London. It tasted as fresh as it looked.  The only thing I might change next time is just to slice my baguette a bit thinner so I can get it more easily into my mouth without spilling any of those tasty tomatoes down my top.  Made for the Chow Hound team for ZWT5."
482933,449,5/13/2009,5,Perfectly delicious plus easy!   Rainy here so our special lunch is helping us--disfrute del dia (enjoy the day).   Thank you FT for posting.  Made for Chow Hounds for ZWT5.
58104,450,5/13/2009,5,"Delicioso! 
Didn`t have to change a thing! Served with Cabernet Sauvignon (Reserva), Penedes, Spain.
Perfecto!"
1446971,450,11/16/2009,5,yummy. I was looking to recreate tapas from a recent trip to Barcelona...this was perfect!
871008,450,7/24/2008,5,"I made this and it was excellent! The only changes I made were that I baked the eggplant on the cookie sheet for an additional 5-10 min., sliced the eggplant about 1/4-inch thick, and put it on top of angel hair pasta. Even my husband, who doesn't like eggplant, ate several servings!!! Yum!"
1055438,454,12/11/2008,5,"I made this and it was yummy! My husband, who doesn't like eggplant, tried it and loved it too. I'll make this again!"
801865,454,6/10/2009,5,My husband and I loved this!  I made the adjustments that Renae C. suggested and it turned out so good.  The only changes that I made was to use Barilla 5 cheese spaghetti sauce instead of the canned tomato sauce and used Mexican cheese (that's what I had on hand) and it still turned out great.
848136,456,7/3/2009,4,My boyfriend and I loveed this recipe. I felt that it was a little dry so I added more sauce and cheese.
965414,456,7/16/2009,5,This is my favorite WW recipe!!
1041886,456,8/31/2009,5,"This makes a great sandwich on a 1 point ""Deli Flatbread"" that is available now! Yum!!!"
54678,456,10/30/2009,4,I'm still learning to like eggplant... even grew a few in the garden this year and I'm trying WW. First bite was bitter but after that it was fine. My husband cut up the leftovers into rice I believe and it was great
666947,456,12/9/2009,5,"<b>IMPORTANT:</b> To get the best texture and flavor, it's important to salt and sweat the eggplant before you bake it. It's easy. Just sprinkle slices with salt of choice and give them 20-30 mins to pull the moisture out. Once they're done, rinse and pat them dry. They are now ready to bread and bake! I didn't use Italian seasoning (don't like one of the spices in it), so I just mixed in some Basil, Oregano, and Thyme. You can use a smaller baking dish, you don't need a 9X13 if you're creating 3 layers. I served this on whole wheat angel hair and instead og canned tomato sauce, I used a jar of pasta sauce. I'll definitely make it again. The first time I made this recipe I didn't salt the eggplant and it was very tough. When I made it again with that change, it tasted like restaurant quality eggplant parmesan."
450571,456,6/6/2010,5,Love it.  Super easy eggplant parm recipe that I can do on a weeknight.  Thanks for posting!
213407,456,7/21/2010,5,"Made this yesterday and it was fantastic.  I cut my eggplant a little thick, but baked about 20 mins on each side and layered in 8 x 8 pan.  I also added a little extra tomato sauce and cheese.  I will definitely make this again."
1235658,456,8/9/2011,5,This was  very easy to make and tasted fabulous.  The only change that I made was to use gluten free breadcrumbs.  This baked up very nicely.
243474,456,11/25/2011,5,"Would never have guessed this is a healthy dish!  Followed danakscullyt64's advise and ""sweated"" the eggplant.  Sliced the eggplant before I realized I should have peeled it.  Didn't seem to hurt at all to leave the skin on. From Renae C.'s advise, I baked it on a cookie sheet for 15 minutes on each side. To finish baking with the sauce and cheese, I used a 7 x 11 glass dish and had just enough for two layers.  Excellent!"
41218,456,7/19/2012,5,"Very tasty and will make this again!  I followed the recipe except for the suggestion of sweating the eggplant, used garlic italian bread crumbs, and Lidia's Chucky Eggplant Marinara.  I also had a few veggies I needed to use before spoiling, so while layering items, I added baby spinach leaves and mushrooms on top of each layer of eggplant (photo submitted).  I used exactly the amount of sauce and mozarella cheese as called for and my photo looks different than the other submission.  This recipe does NOT lack in flavor and it's healthy - can't beat that!"
1362457,456,1/11/2013,3,I am giving this recipe 3 stars only because I think it technically worked and was edible but I found it very bland overall. I followed the recipe to the t but I did add the step of sweating the eggplant before breading it. I think this would be better with more added seasonings to the italian bread crumbs and a regular pasta sauce as opposed to the plain tomato sauce. The texture came out nicely so I may try it again with some more seasoning... I think I'd also incorportate zuchini slices to bulk up the recipe a bit.
1179225,456,3/2/2015,4,"Loved it, except my eggplant was pretty tough, I even took the extra step of sweating it. Oh well, maybe it was my eggplant. I&#039;ll try cooking it a little longer next time and test a bite for tenderness. The flavors were wonderful. I think these would make a great sandwich filling. Thanks for sharing this very simple, delicious recipe."
1628373,456,7/11/2016,5,"This recipe was spot on! The &quot;sweaty eggplant&quot; is the way to go and doesn't add much time to the cooking process if it is the first thing that you do. I added Parmesan cheese, Italaian Seasoning, salt, white pepper, black pepper, garlic salt (I'm out of garlic powder) and a dash of celery salt to the bread crumbs. Instead of using just bread crumbs, I mixed half Seasoned Panko crumbs and half Italian bread crumbs (what I had on hand). I have made this recipe a few times throughout the years, slightly tweaking each time. It comes out great every time!"
227652,456,1/14/2017,5,"This was WONDERFUL! I made some changes but stuck to the recipe as best I could. I salted the eggplant as previous reviewers did to pull out the moisture. I switched the amounts of Parmesan cheese &amp; breadcrumbs (used whole wheat) &amp; added some oregano. I got 8 slices out of my eggplant so I was only able to do 2 layers. I didn't use egg whites; just nonstick cooking spray, used low fat mozzarella, and used spaghetti sauce (not regular tomato sauce). I think baking a little longer would get it heated through better; next time I'll bake for 15-20 min. Served over whole wheat spaghetti. Thanks so much for sharing!!"
2001341923,456,2/19/2017,3,Cool. Jesus Loves You!!! :)
2002182126,456,6/10/2018,5,"Outstanding. So good to have a great recipe while still losing weight. Missed sweating the eggplants but still went fine. I did use an oil spritzer and browned the breaded (used Panko) eggplant on a griddle. Added my &quot;bruschetta&quot; (tomatoes, basil &amp; red pepper flakes) home canned sauce, and a little garlic powder, cheese . layered in a 9 x 13 oven baking dish. Even my husband who doesn't ever want eggplant, ate this and like it. I had made it for just me since he was gone. He came home and had a snack. Will make it again many times. Placed it over 2 oz(dry) of cooked spaghetti which I spritzed with spray (fake) butter. Amazing, and so few points. Thanks Rhlannon."
1928828,456,6/10/2011,0,Great site!
1802999449,456,8/5/2014,5,Awesome quick dessert!! So Yummy!!
212497,456,1/21/2011,5,"Wonderful! My kids inhaled this and they now put it on everything -- burgers, hot dogs, chicken nuggets. Anything! Thanks so much for posting!"
1926827,456,6/7/2011,5,"I kept seeing this recipe turn up with every search, and eventually caved and tried it.  SO glad I did!!!  <br/><br/>I'm very finicky about sauces, I was relieved to notice almost *no* difference between this and the Micky Ds sauce.  I tried some of the Thousand Island variations, none of them were even close to this, Thanks for posting!"
1926889,456,6/7/2011,5,"This is the same recipe I use, it's phenomenal!  I did a side-by-side comparison against the real deal, and it was impossible to tell which was which.  And it's good on so many things, fries, onion rings, sandwiches... the possibilities are endless.<br/><br/>The only thing I do differently is to microwave the sauce for 20 seconds after combining the ingredients.  This ensures that the sugar melts and it blends the flavors more effectively.  <br/><br/>Amazing recipe, thanks for posting!"
179133,456,10/5/2011,5,"I don't eat McDonald's (it doesn't like me) so can't compare this to the ""real deal"" but don't care - it's good by me no matter how it compares! I did vary *slightly* from the recipe by using all mayo and all dill relish but I added a touch more sugar to make up the difference in sweetness. For the French dressing I used recipe #135295 since I had some made up already from a couple nights ago. Can't wait to try this on a burger or fries! Thanks for sharing!"
120121,456,10/10/2011,5,"I don't do McDonald's, but I gave this to a friend who was searching for the real deal because, of all the wannabe recipes out there, this is the one that just sounded right to me.  She called just now to say that it was fabulous and her family just freaked out at how close it was to the original."
2164780,456,1/29/2012,2,"It's not bad, but to me it was a bit bland and really didn't taste like the heavenly Big Mac sauce. I'm familiar with this recipe as it has been circulating around the web for several years and it supposedly came from a McDonalds restaurant's employee instruction booklet, but I honestly doubt it. I've personally found that Russian dressing (in particular, Ken's Russian Dressing) is the closest approximation to whatever McDonalds puts on their Big Macs, and definitely tastes better than this recipe."
2002084345,456,3/30/2018,1,Mush
2000805503,456,1/7/2016,5,"This is the recipe I found years ago. It is the one in the 1969 managers&#039; manual. So far, it is the closest to the real sauce.  I would like to add that I tried the one I saw in the video by the Canadian McD chef. The one with garlic powder, mustard, and praprika............that one is not even close. It is awful. It has an overpowering taste of garlic and mustard.........none of which are in the original. I really believe that was a fake video to make people give up and go buy a Big Mac."
1920860,456,5/30/2011,5,Had this camping over the weekend.... EXCELLENT... everyone (even the kids) loved it!
37449,456,7/5/2012,5,This made a great spread for toast. I enjoyed it. I did scale down the recipe for one. Thanks!
167242,456,6/28/2011,5,"This was so, so good!  I was actually really surprised at how good something so simple could be.  I thought the potatoes would just be filler, but they're weirdly integral to the dish.  And with that creamy cheese and onion.... it's heaven.  Probably went a little heavy on the bacon and onion.  Served this with an arugula salad and some white wine for a dinner, and it was wonderful, easy, and totally satisfying.  Will definitely be making again!"
58104,456,5/1/2010,5,"Spicy good!
I used chopped clams in place of the oysters. Added more shrimp to make up for the craw-fish I couldn`t get. Used fresh 1 1/2 teaspoons thyme, 1 1/2 teaspoons basil was used in place of the dry. Used a red onion an orange bell pepper. I did make shrimp stock along with home made chicken stock. Garlic was kicked up to 6 cloves. I used my pepper flakes in place of the cayenne which consists of very hot chilies. 
Delish and a must make."
204024,456,7/21/2013,4,"Such an adventure to make.  Our crawfish were alive from the seafood market.  We bought a whole crab and cooked and cleaned out the meat.  This definitely expanded our cooking experiences.  That said next time we would leave out the oysters, we discovered we aren&#039;t  oyster lovers.  Good and Tasty Recipe.  Made for ZWT 9."
211184,456,3/22/2011,4,This was a hit with 3 hungry teenagers last night. I was able to fit 6 good sized enchiladas in a 9x13 baking dish. Really easy to make when time is short. I didn't use the optional rice and for the cheddar cheese soup I used Fiesta Nacho. Thanks for sharing the recipe. Made for PAC Spring 2011.
128473,456,5/2/2014,4,"This was an interesting dish.  My dh &amp; I have never tried anything like this before.  It was a pleasant surprise. Quick and easy to make with a nice flavor.  I added a lot of hot pepper sauce to the beans, we like it hot.  We did prefer the beans the following day, the flavor of the sauce had permeated the meat more.  Thank you for sharing your recipe.  Made for Spring PAC 2014."
13593,456,6/20/2002,5,"This was really tasty.  I ended up marinating the chicken overnight and boy what a good flavor the chicken has.  Also I lightened up the recipe by using 1/4 cup of oil versus 1 cup and it came out great.  If there are any leftovers, I will shread the chicken and use in a fresh salad with a honey dressing.  This was very simple to prepare also.  YUM!!"
309629,456,4/10/2006,5,"wow! fabulous! Served it with roasted green beans and coconut rice. Guest raved about it. I did not flatten the chicken, left the breasts plump and baked for 25 min. Came out nice and juicy. I thnk flattened and baked for longer might be dry. "
489214,456,5/4/2007,4,"We marinated the chicken overnight.  The flavor was good, but the ""breading"" of flour got soggy when we baked it (after browning in oil).  Next time, I might skip the flour.  Also, we didn't flatten the chicken, and it turned out juicy and tender.  If I come up with any improvements next time, I'll comment again!"
626746,456,12/12/2007,5,Yummy! It's worth the time and effort for this dish. This has become a new family favorite.
6258,456,9/20/2002,5,A fantastic southern side-dish.  Bacon and yellow crookneck squash absolutely have to go together.  This was so good.  It was so very easy to make and the flavor is so good.  Thanks for posting this recipe...I will be using it a lot!
37868,456,7/11/2003,4,"I love yellow crookneck squash. This is really a very good and easy recipe to follow...I did not change nothing..we loved it. I already had fried bacon in the freezer that I fried myself and saved the bacon drippings and so I picked up at the drippings and cooked the onions added the Squash and seasoned,Crushed the prefried bacon. Just so easy having all the having the bacon cooked and the bacon drippings all ready...Thank You  for a wonderful Veggie. Hugs"
39733,456,2/10/2004,5,"Oh yeah, this is a delicious way to cook yellow squash. I poured out almost all of the bacon grease, just to lighten it up some. It still had the delicious flavor from the bacon drippings just not quite as much saturated fats. My MIL cooks squash this way and it is one of my husband's favorites. Thanks for posting it."
78770,456,2/12/2004,5,"Yep, this has been my favorite way to fix yellow squash for over 30 years. Sometimes I toss a little  red or green bell pepper in with the onions for color.  "
212007,456,8/18/2005,0,***** simply ... divine!
176615,456,9/15/2005,5,"Wonderful! This is how to make ""a mess of squash,"" one of my favorites. I could eat only this for dinner and be perfectly happy. Easy recipe, proportions are just right. Along with salt at the end, I usually add a small pinch of sugar. Thanks, Mysterygirl, for posting!"
56003,458,9/9/2007,5,"Thanks, Mysterygirl.  Taste's just like Mother used to make.  Can never have enough good squash recipes! Simple prep is always a selling point for me."
330545,459,5/11/2009,5,"Awesome!  I must have eaten three of the four portions!  Made for a Taste of Yellow, Spring'09."
2001592532,459,6/21/2017,5,It was easy and this was the first time I used bacon with squash and onions. Everyone loved it! But I poured most of the drippings out before I cooked the onions and squash.
46545,460,6/5/2003,5,"Please don't be put off by the amount of garlic here folks!  I made this for my husband and 2 sons, who are not that crazy about garlic, and they all loved this.  I kept my chicken whole and baked it in an oven cooking bag.  It turned out perfectly.  The house smelled so good!  And the juices made a great gravy with a roasted garlic flavor.  "
118840,460,9/25/2009,5,"Of the three recipes I made and reviewed for Fall '09 PAC, this was my favorite.  I liked it so much I've made it three times  :)  I took it to work for a potluck and it was devoured in no time ... AND I made the last batch and froze individual servings for lunches.  Wonderful, wonderful dish!"
198238,460,2/28/2005,5,"I just made this for a church Bake Off and won ""Best Taste"" for it!  Did a couple variations... Used the Cake Mix Frosting (#104747... YUM!!) instead, and in the middle I put the cherries BETWEEN the frosting and chips.  Better visual effect to have two layers of white.  The chocolate curls and cherries on top made it look beautiful!  "
89831,460,11/29/2006,5,"This is a great cake recipe, perfect to serve at holiday season to guests, I had to increase the icing sugar slightly in the whipping cream frosting (just personal preference) I also think I will increase the sugar in the cake batter next time I make it, great recipe BK!...Kitten :)"
169430,460,4/8/2007,4,"This served double duty today. It was dessert for Easter dinner and also DH's birthday cake. I made it as a sheet cake using vanilla buttercream icing in place of the whipped cream and placed the cherry filling on top of that. Kato, it ask for ""cherry pie filling""  but drained and chopped? After reading that and the directions I wasn't sure if you wanted the pie filling or a can of cherries. I had the pie filling and used it all right from the can. It met with great guy approval. As no body else has mentioned this I guess it's just me but it didn't rise as high as I had hoped and I wondered if possibly the amounts of soda and baking powder should be reversed? DH says Thank You for a great birthday cake."
382071,460,7/4/2007,3,This was good and pretty. I made it in a 13x9 glass pan. I baked the cake for 25 minutes but it was a little dry and didn't have much flavor. I drained and chopped the sweet dark cherry pie filling but wish I didn't...I think it would have been good to poke holes in the cake and then pour the complete filling over it with the glaze. I topped it with the whipped cream frosting. I omitted the white chocolate chips. Made for 1-2-3 hit wonders.
252514,461,1/11/2008,5,"Mmmmm I'm munching on one with my morning coffee as I type. Love the hint of flavor present from the molasses and honey. Very tasty, thank you! :)"
442988,461,2/10/2008,5,"I had to try these -- I'm in Boston, it's snowing outside, and I'm so homesick for L.A. I can't stand it!  I loved the Rose Cafe, and spent many an hour there in the early 1980s.  These muffins didn't disappoint.  I was very skeptical that they'd turn out OK; the batter was very thin.  But the flavor and texture turned out great.  I made 'em as mini-muffins and am very pleased with them.  Thanks for reminding me about the Rose Cafe, and thanks for a great muffin recipe!"
323134,464,10/19/2008,5,"It is so good! I did exactly as the recipe stated and I go 24 mini muffins (17 minutes).  The raisins and the nuts (pecans) just added to the muffin, also, I loved the flavor of molasses. By the way, my batter was not thin at all, nice and thick."
160974,464,5/22/2009,5,"These are excellent bran muffins- 
There's a bit more bran to flour ratio than I am used to, but it turns out I like that. It makes for a chewier texture (not as cake-like). I was glad I had buttermilk on hand because I think it keeps the texture good, without being too brittle.My favorite ingred. in bran muffins is molasses so I knew I'd like the flavor. I did think they were a bit faster to stir together than other recipes, too. Thanks Lynn, for posting.

252683,464,12/8/2009,5,Used this recipe in my cooking class for the dairy unit.  It was easy to follow and the students had enough time to make it then eat it the next day.  thanks!
1234551,464,5/5/2009,5,"This was so good!  We had sandwiches with it today, but I have leftover mashed potatoes from yesterdays meal; so that is luch tomorrow with the beef.  Can't wait, because it was good on the sandwiches, but I know it will be just as good on the potatoes.  Thanks for a great recipe!"
358544,464,6/14/2009,5,"The meat was so tender!! Loved the sauce mix it cooked in. We had this on sandwhiches, but I think it would be good on rice also. Will have to try with rice next time! Thank you for a great recipe."
1325795,464,7/16/2009,5,"Fabulous, one of the best recipes i have ever cooked.

1328781,464,7/19/2009,5,"Thanks for the yummy recipe!  My boys all loved it and the house smelled so delicious as it was cooking!  We had it on rice and next time I think I will try the potatoes like others have suggested.  It's so nice to make an easy, quick meal which everyone gobbles up and asks for more!  Thanks Jacquelyn!  Theresa"
537617,464,7/27/2009,5,This was really great!  We had it over mashed potatoes with kimchi  and a eggroll on the side.  I know it sounds weird but it was SO GOOD!  I cook alot of Korean food and this has most of the same seasonings as Bulgoki but tastes totally different.  It also just fell apart in the pot because it was so tender.  Thanks for a yummy new recipe!
4291,465,7/28/2009,5,"This was easy and delicious, so my DH says, which is a terrific testament to the recipe...he usually says, ""it was alright.""  i don't eat roast.  I will make again.  JacquelynLee, thanks for posting a good recipe.  Sue"
1318815,466,8/5/2009,5,"I wish I could give this one more than five stars!  We've just been to Ireland for a short break and I made this for a family gathering.  Every last bite was gobbled down, and several people asked me for the recipe.  A real winner!"
575070,467,8/14/2009,5,This was a delicious recipe that the whole family loved!  We did as suggested and had it on hamburger buns.  My father even said it was better than the brisket we sometimes have on hamburger buns!
1372733,467,9/2/2009,5,Loved it and it was a hit with the kids too which is always good!
749562,469,9/21/2009,5,This was excellent!!!  Served when we had family over and everyone really liked it.  I cooked for 12 hours on low in my slowcooker and used a chuck roast.  I think I will double the gravy mixture next time because everyone wanted extra poured on their sandwiches and my leftovers have no sauce left.  Great recipe.  Thank you:)
141972,469,11/9/2009,5,Very good - I used a flat iron roast - but sliced it into 2 inch slices first since I started the recipe a little late.  It was done in 3 and a half hours.  I increased the sauce by half based on comments but I don't think I would do that again as I had more than enough sauce.  Smells wonderful while cooking.
1141909,469,1/4/2010,5,"OUTSTANDING!!!!!!!!!! Yum yum yum. So ridiculously easy to make, i had everything i needed in the pantry (except the roast of course). I used a 1kg lump of blade and it shrunk down to the tiniest amount, so next time i'm gonna put a monster in. I cant wait to have guests over to share this delicious meat with!!! Thank you so so much for sharing this delightful recipe."
311625,469,1/22/2010,5,"Used an eye of round roast (about 3.5 lbs), doubled the sauce, and cooked for about 8 hours. It was super flavorful and tender, easy to shred. When my husband took his first bite he said ""OH yeah""...And he's not generally the most complimentary person! Served on recipe #183081 (which is the best bun recipe ever). Thanks JacquelynLee!"
146552,469,1/24/2010,3,"I will fix this again but cut the sesame oil down.  The flavor of the sesame oil took over and was too strong for my taste.  Maybe it was the type of oil I used, but will fix this again cutting the sesame oil in half.  We served over mashed potatoes, but I felt that it would be better over rice.  Thank you for posting."
13483,469,10/9/2010,5,Very easy and tasty recipe.  I minced the garlic and onion in a processor.  I also added some hoi sin sauce and hot sauce.  I did mince up the meat and there was quite a bit of it!!  Great  leftovers!!  Thanks for the post.
439797,469,11/10/2010,5,Easy recipe.
28636,471,12/21/2010,5,"Quick, easy and delicious.  DH ate it on a bun as you suggested and DD with rice - both were great!  I did cut the amount of sesame oil to suit my family.  Served with a salad of shredded napa cabbage, snow peas, onion and carrots tossed in an asian vinaigrette this made for a great dinner!  Thanks JacquelynLee :)"
502302,471,12/29/2010,4,"We really liked this. After reading the reviews I halved the sesame, since I often find it too strong. I was happy with that. I used a boned-in chuck roast. I didn't have much time so had to cook it on high. We really liked it although the gravy was a little salty for my liking. I may just use water in place of the beef broth or reduce the amount of soy sauce next time. I served over mashed sweet potatoes. Told hubby of the suggestion of kaiser rolls and he said he would be interested in trying it like ""au jus"" and dip the rolls into the broth."
226863,471,3/14/2011,4,"I loved how easy this is to make.  I decided to serve this on ciabatta rolls instead of kaiser rolls as suggested, and this worked out well.  Served au jus.  Topped it with a little shredded cabbage, and spread with mayo and horseradish.  This is very good!  I have leftovers, and will try those over mashed potatoes to test it out that way.  Made for PAC Spring 2011."
204024,472,3/16/2011,5,"One of the best things to come out of my crock pot in months! Rich savory flavor, tender enough to shred with a fork.  We served it over rice with a few stir-fried veggies for color.  We like sesame a lot, so we used what the recipe called for and loved it.  Made for PAC."
1048179,472,10/4/2011,5,This was a really tender moist roast. I was expecting a stronger Korean flavor but it more tasted like just a delicious roast. Next time I was thinking I could add pineapple while it is cooking in the crockpot and a bit more soy. I think that would be really tasty.
74567,473,11/21/2012,5,"Simple and great taste. Served it over rice and some green pees, it's a keeper"
1396309,473,3/12/2013,0,"I made this using petite sirloin steak and it didn't work out at all. I can't blame the recipe for that so I am not going to give this any stars just to be fair. My meat turned out really dry and pretty tasteless. Again I really can't blame the recipe for this, I just wanted to put out a warning to others to be careful which meat to use. I would like to try this recipe again with a longer cooking meat."
369715,478,7/17/2013,5,This was really good. I mixed all the ingredients in a container so all I would have to do in the morning was dump it over the roast in the crockpot. I did only add 1/2 teaspoon of pepper as a whole teaspoon seemed a lot to me. I did forgot to add the onions but even without them this was so good. I cooked mine on low for six hours and then it was on warm for another three hours. The meat was really tender. I shredded the meat and put it on sandwiches with some of the gravy. Everyone loved it and they aren&#039;t always fans of my roasts in a crock pot.
8344778,478,12/13/2013,5,"Legit and authentic! I&#039;ve had &quot;issues&quot; with making slow cooker pot roasts in the past.  This recipe hits the spot and has been a family favorite for some time now.  I do however deviate from the recipe a little bit by adding a bit more soy sauce and less sesame oil.  I also blend a onion, add onion powder, extra garlic and add some kiwi to tenderize.  This combination is what I use to marinate other Korean style meats - bulgogi, galbi, ddaktoritang.  Works out well and so simple to make.  Very delicious.  Also, if the roast is super big, I like to cut into smaller pieces and cook in low heat for at least 5 hours.  Serve with rice and kimchee.  Hits the spot."
307214,478,2/13/2014,5,"Flavour was wonderful, but i had problems...  I thought I had a roast but instead all I could find were round steaks.  I would not advice repeating this substitution.  When serving, we had to cube the steaks because they just wouldn&#039;t be pulled!!  Meat was a little chewy but still had great taste and we served it with rice.  I would definitely try this again WHEN I HAVE A ROAST."
119956,483,3/17/2014,5,"This was easy and good tasting. The first night I served it over rice with a green veg. Then we heated it up and had sandwiches. I used a two and a half pound pot roast which didn&#039;t have too much shrinkage. I didn&#039;t have the sesame oil so subbed veg oil without a problem. Thanks, JacquelynLee."
515278,483,10/30/2014,5,Wonderful! I might try it with chicken thighs next time.
32058,484,11/14/2014,5,"Followed recipe pretty much exactly, amazing flavor. &lt;br/&gt;I did sear the roast in veg oil before putting in the crockpot on High for 5 hours."
394077,484,12/31/2014,4,Very easy and good.  Thank you.
829250,486,3/9/2015,5,Very good! Ate with white rice and stir fry veggies.
50315,489,12/22/2005,5,Favorite banana muffins for my family.
2001675217,490,12/18/2017,5,"It was super easy and everyone loved it! I doubled the recipe and used four pounds of chuck roast. I didn’t use sesame oil because I was concerned that it might be overpowering. I used a little extra soy sauce, and I cooked the beef for eight hours on low. I think that cooking it longer would have been even better, but it was great at eight hours. I served the beef over mashed potatoes with stir-fry veggies. I plan to serve the leftovers on some form of bread yet to be decided."
545970,490,8/11/2010,4,"I really liked this jam.  Nice texture and consistency.  Not overwhelmingly sweet like some jams can be.  I liked the layers of flavors but my jam didn't have any spicyness from the peppers.  I will admit that I was a little confused about exactly what to do with them.  Were the fresh cayenne peppers supposed to be chopped and added or left whole and added?  Whatever the case, I had only dried red cayenne peppers so I used that.  Only 1 and left it whole and then removed it before putting the jam in jars.  My neighbors really enjoyed this jam although my parents preferred your vanilla fig preserves.  Also I used Gran Gala instead of the Grand Marnier as that is what I had on hand.  Overall, this recipe is "" jammin' ""! lol."
825843,492,9/2/2012,5,"This is a really complex jam! Orange on the front, and a gentle aftertaste of pepper on the end. I didn't have pectin, so I made do without, just cooked for a little longer to reduce and gel. It's really wonderful. Maybe a little sweeter than I wanted, but I think that's just because the figs on my tree were incredibly ripe at the time. Might try with less sugar next time. My only complaint is that I can't taste the rosemary enough. I might add more next time."
222564,492,10/5/2013,5,"Wonderful flavors! Served with cheese and crackers, so good!"
2000143593,493,4/15/2015,4,"I made this for dinner tonight. It was pretty good. I added a bit of soy sauce drizzled over it. Indeed it was a nice, simple, comfort food kind of dish. Thanks!"
25792,495,3/26/2003,5,"Steph these are great, crust is just right, topping is carmelly and gooey, just a word to the wise don't cook it too long as it gets hard.  Ty for a great recipe, next time I will try with pecans."
34879,496,2/11/2004,5,"YES!  Perfect, we used it like tacos the first time and the next was over rice.  Even tried it with egg as in your suggestion and it was very good.  DH wants me to make this again.(he is an egg nut, so it's a perfect supper for him)
Thanks SueL, your recipes are just right for us."
62675,498,3/20/2004,5,Stuff this into green plantains which have been slit lenghtwise and bake until they are soft.  This is very very cubano.
333518,498,7/13/2006,1,"If you like real, Cuban picadillo, stay away from this recipe !!! :( I grew up in South Florida with friends living with their Cuban, non-English speaking relatives. The relatives often cooked picadillo. Wonderful stuff!! My mother learned to cook picadillo from some of her close Cuban friends. Mama's version of Picadillo is awesome...but not diabetic-friendly; her recipe uses brown sugar and potatoes. I also eat in Cuban restaurants. None of those picadillo's have the overpowering taste of vinegar and cumin that this recipe has. Recommend replacing the cumin with oregano...that's more traditional. Recommend replacing the vinegar with either water or broth...you want to taste picadillo, not pickling juice. :( If you want to keep the seasonings, you might try adding some brown sugar. My mother's recipe uses brown sugar. BTW, the sofrito was very tasty, but overpowered by the vinegar and cumin. :("
464333,498,11/23/2011,5,"I actually thought this was awesome!!! I LOVED the combo of flavors and, at first glance, it looks more complicated than it is. This one is definitely going to be in the regular rotation - thanks!!"
424680,498,2/21/2008,5,"Here's a nice way to put everything in the same pot, so to speak! I used 3 chicken breasts, then increased the amount of OJ, lemon juice & rosemary! The increased juices gave the brown rice [that I served the chicken over] a nice taste, too! Certainly a keeper! [Tagged, made & reviewed for Newest Zaar Tag, 08A, game]"
1807042,498,1/26/2011,5,"We have been using this recipe for over two decades.  Don't know where SWMBO found it but it was pre-WWW so I suspect some magazine or cookbook.  We have always enjoyed it served over rice.  We have also prepped it for camping trips over the years.  Bright, filling meal that everyone will enjoy (or should)."
425677,498,6/2/2008,2,"This was okay.  I had trouble with the egg whites.  First they were too runny...then too hard... If I ever made this again, I would just omit the eggs all together.  The flavor was good, but the texture was kinda nasty... Made for ZWT 4 2008."
88099,498,10/8/2005,5,Oh my.  This truly was delicious.  The combination of herbs was right on in my opinion.  This is not only a good veggie dip but is also good with chips.  Thanks Deely for a great one.
537179,498,9/17/2009,5,This was really good. Made for Fall PAC 2009
222478,498,4/20/2007,5,"Mmmm, really good curry that had fantastic flavour and some sweet and sour type characteristics that went together superbly with the duck! Rather than try and dice all the duck I left a lot of it whole like legs, wings etc which I thought added to the presentation.
I like a bit of heat in my curries so used a mix of three small hot fresh chillies, and one of each of a dried habanero, a chipotle and a jalapeno with all the seeds in place. Because of what was available I had to make a few changes, I used standard fresh basil instead of Thai, ginger instead of galangal and because I couldn't find any shrimp paste I dry-fried a handful of prawns (shrimp) for around 15 minutes, sliced and ground with the mortar and pestle. A really great meal served over rice, thanks Jewelies!"
54716,502,7/7/2005,5,"Very Simple to make and delicious. The combination of macadamia nuts, Banana and brown sugar make this reipce a winner. Will definately be make this again."
236586,502,8/16/2005,5,I made this for a Hawaiian themed party. It was DELICIOUS and moist. I will definitely make it again. In fact it will be my main banana bread recipe. GREAT. 
157425,502,6/8/2006,5,Very good banana bread and love the macadamia nuts! I did have to bake mine a little longer for the middle to get done but so worth the wait. Thanks Rita!!
500635,502,6/9/2007,5,This bread is absolutely incredible! Follow recipe as is and it's PERFECT! Thanks so much for the recipe.
96796,502,6/12/2007,5,"This couldn't be easier and it's SO DECADENT. I could eat this every day, and the flavors take me back to my honeymoon in Maui. Thanks so much for posting!  One tip - using your hands, break apart any hard lumps in the brown sugar before mixing with the butter.  Otherwise you'll have lumps of it in your bread."
526666,502,6/22/2011,5,"This was a great tasting bread, tho I should have baked for a little longer. I did add about 5 minutes to the 1 hour bake time, and 15 minutes would probably have been right. I love banana and macadamia nut ANYTHING, and this fits the bill. I'll keep it close, for when the pang of needing a nut bread strikes! Thanks for sharing, Rita~."
1802829537,502,6/16/2014,5,"OMG, this is so amazingly lovely to eat. I just took it out of the oven and had some while it was steamy, and I&#039;m sure glad I did. If it&#039;s even better tomorrow, I&#039;m going to declare this the best thing I ever baked."
47510,502,6/17/2006,5,Excellent salad.  I loved the flavors in the vinaigrette.  The salad was perfect for a light lunch.
68960,502,2/5/2007,4,This is exactally Mum's old recipe and one that both my grandmother made. Out of the good old Edmonds cookbook. Thanks for posting Sharon!
618715,503,6/7/2009,4,"I had just bought a large bunch of mint this morning and was looking for a sauce to make with it for lamb. This was quick, easy, and pretty good. I served this over Recipe#367872. Made for my teammate on the Epicurean Queens, ZWT5: Family Picks."
313120,503,9/20/2006,5,Wonderful.  I wrapped the chicken breasts with the bacon and fried them to cut back on the baking time.  Also heated the soup mixture and added minced garlic to it.  Thanks for the great recipe.
641071,503,1/22/2008,5,"This was really great!  We added more chili seasoning, but otherwise pretty much stuck to the recipe.  Thank you so much!  We enjoyed leftovers for lunch today."
303545,504,11/1/2009,5,"Delicious!  I love a good punch with sherbert in it, and this fit the bill.  Ours however didn't turn out very green, but instead quite orange.  It was a big hit, and we were able to adjust the vodka to the tastes of our costumed guests :) Thanks for posting, Alia!"
346576,506,12/8/2007,5,Loved them!  Very quick snack.  I didn't have said gadget (I missed the show this year :() so I just sliced the onions by hand.  Thanks for posting this recipe!
1782773,506,7/21/2011,5,YUM! Came out perfect! So easy and tasty.
363420,506,9/21/2013,5,awesome
269480,506,6/2/2008,5,"I made these by zipping it in the microwave taking it out once to mix well then followed rest of recipe.  I somehow suggest waiting for about a minute or two before mixing the egg whites so it doesn't solidify from too much heat and for the texture to be smooth.  Overall, I enjoyed it! I love the coffee creamy taste and I will be making this again as it's an easy coffee custard to make. Thank you! Made for ZWT4."
510313,506,6/5/2008,4,Made & reviewed for ZWT 4 ~ Kumquat's Kookin' Kaboodles! I thought this recipe looked interesting & am so glad I tried it! I left out the egg & used decaffe coffee so the kids could enjoy this with us (DS has raw egg allergy). I also tripled the recipe & it turned out perfect...light & creamy & a delicious dessert. Thanks!
1072593,506,5/20/2010,5,I'll take this to go in the 'large' size. Made for ZWT 6.
223979,506,5/27/2010,5,Yum!!  Turned out great.  I topped it with whipped cream and mini chocolate chips.  Made for ZWT 6.
107583,506,8/22/2010,5,"Delicious!  For the coffee, I dissolved 2 teaspoons instant Espresso Powder in water, since I forgot to save some coffee from the pot.  After stirring in the egg, I tasted it and thought it was missing something, so stirred in a teaspoon of almond extract.  I am going to try other extracts also.  Orange I think would be good!  Made for tag game at Kittencalskitchen.com"
101732,506,1/20/2009,5,"I was surprised that no one has reviewed this yet! It was very easy to put together and tasted great!! I was out of bread crumbs so I made Recipe #120329. I soaked the chicken in Kraft Ceaser Italian and cooked at 350* for 40 minutes, flipping half way through. This made a great lunch for my daughter and I! We had salad and a slice of buttered French bread on the side. Thanks so much for posting!! :)"
969481,506,5/25/2009,5,We omitted the bread crumbs because we put this on our campfire.. Let the chicken breasts soak for about 6 hours poking small holes in the chicken so the dressing would get soaked up. So simple and yet so tasty!
513551,506,8/21/2009,5,This was delicious and so easy to make. Thanks!
330505,506,4/3/2010,5,"Very easy to make.  I had a problem keeping the bread crumbs on when taking off the tray, but that's okay it was still very light, tender and flavorful.  Thanks for posting!!!"
953275,506,11/5/2009,5,"Fantastic! This will be my new go-to recipe for chicken. It greatly relies on the spice mixture...I used the one you have posted and just whittled it down to get roughly 3 tbsp. The mint MAKES this so I wouldn't omit it, even if you have to use dried. This literally took 5 minutes to throw together in the morning - let it sit all day, and then threw it in the oven at about 375....had a nice thin sauce to pour overtop as well because you get quite a bit of marinade here for the amount of chicken. I don't eat chicken, but I love this recipe and my family did as well. Thanks HH!"
477439,506,3/14/2010,5,This is very good!! I marinated it for the day in the fridge and then baked it in the oven @ 375 for about 35 min. Very tasty Chicken. Thank you for posting the recipe!!
233238,506,7/30/2009,5,"Yes, indeed, this is the best tabbouli salad I've made.  The fine grind bulghur does make a difference in the texture and cooking time.  I didn't have tamari soy sauce, though, so will buy some for the next time to see the difference.  Recommend this recipe to all."
126440,506,8/12/2009,5,"I loved the flavor of this salad.  I'm not sure if my bulgur was #1 grind so let it sit for one hour, then added the other ingredients.  Loved the kick from the cayenne pepper.  Served it with Recipe #303946 and Recipe #93401."
1428015,507,4/11/2010,5,"I made this recipe 3 times and after experimenting with a couple of additions, I love it.  I followed the recipe exactly and then added 1/2 of an english cucumber, chopped,  and 1 1/2 packets of raw sugar.   This reduced the acidity a little.  Shared with others who loved it also. Thanks for posting the recipe."
394077,508,11/3/2011,5,I love this salad.  So refreshing and clean tasting...I can eat it with everything and everyday...so good...thanks for posting it.
2153320,508,1/19/2012,5,"This recipe totally lives up to its name. The best! I made it with Quinoa instead of bulgar wheat and it was FABULOUS. I just prepared one cup of dry organic Quinoa per the packaging instructions and proceeded as stated. I kept all of the veggies and other ingredients the same as I think Quinoa poofs up a bit more than the bulgar wheat. Plus I like lots of stuff in my salad. I eased up by just a bit on the olive oil and red wind vinegar but I don't think the whole amount would make much difference. Also, I used about 4 parts parsley to 1-2 parts mint which I got from my garden and is stronger than the stuff you buy in the store. I probably had at least a full 3/4 cup of parsley when chopped. To me, it is hard to determine how much ""one bunch"" is, so that's how I handled it. GREAT, GREAT recipe. Seriously the best Tabouleh Salad I have ever made."
937635,508,2/12/2012,5,Great recipe! I left out the mint because they didn't have any at the store. Next time I'll chop the parsley more finely. Excellent flavor. Thanks!
2332788,512,7/17/2012,5,"Yummy! I substituted cilantro for one half of the parsley, because that is what I had and used garlic instead of the cayenne....wow."
7578910,512,9/11/2013,5,"Tabbouleh has always been something I wanted to make, and this recipe is the one I will use every time! I substituted Quinoa in place of the bulgur, using 1 1/2 cups of dry Quinoa to 3 cups of water and cooking it according to the directions on its package. This made the perfect amount of Quinoa to veggie ratio since I prefer a more balanced salad. Any less Quinoa &amp; I think the parsley would have been too dominant. I used curly leaf parsley, which to me seemed to be just as flavorful as flat leaf but not as pungent. I chopped it very finely &amp; took other&#039;s advice &amp; measured 3/4 cup to 1 cup loosely packed. My &quot;1 bunch&quot; of green onions was 6 onions, &amp; I used the whole onion-- both the green &amp; the white. Where the recipe calls for 1 medium onion chopped, I only added 1/4 chopped to the salad, &amp; it was a little too strong even with such a small amount. So I suggest using a mild or sweet onion or leaving it out altogether; I thought the green onions gave it great flavor on their own. I used fresh garden mint as well &amp; only needed 1/4 cup or less after it was chopped. I used 16oz fresh cherry tomatoes quartered, &amp; kept the olive oil &amp; red wine vinegar as stated. Quinoa can be a little sticky so the oil really helped keep the texture of traditional tabbouleh. My only additions were 1 English cucumber finely chopped, which boosted the texture &amp; flavor immensely, &amp; about 2Tbls of balsamic vinegar to give the salad just a little bit of sweet without having to worry about granules of sugar showing up in the salad. I served this wonderful dish with hummus, pita bread, kalamata olives, &amp; marinated Greek chicken kabobs (recipe was from a different website). Everyone loved it all!! Thank you for sharing this recipe blucoat!!"
2032489,512,1/30/2014,5,"A most excellent recipe! I cut the recipe in half.  No rice wine vinegar - used balsamic instead... and added cucumbers. It is the perfect balance of bulgar to parsley ratio.  A few years ago,I needed a last minute dish to take to a gathering.  Looking at what I had on hand and following a whim, I stumbled across a fantastic combo of mixing tabouli with a container of classic tuna salad (not mayonaisy) from Whole Foods. The flavors came together perfectly and it was a huge hit!  The whole room wanted the &quot;recipe&quot;.  Since then, when I make tabouli, I often add a can of Albacore tuna to the mix and Wa La(!) - an excellent meal that is appreciated by all.  Top with a slice of avocado and you have heaven on a plate. Without fail, recipe requests follow the first bite. It just works. In-joy."
2000192337,512,5/8/2015,5,"I have made this several times with quinoa. It is truly the best tabbouleh I&#039;ve ever had! I use red onion, Italian flat-leaf parsley, cilantro (not too keen on mint leaves), red cherry tomatoes, and sometimes I&#039;ll add peas, green onion, cucumber, jalape&ntilde;o or Serrano pepper, and a little minced fresh garlic. The cayenne pepper is a must. Fabulous and healthy! Everyone I&#039;ve ever served it to loves it. Thanks for the awesome recipe."
1800290575,512,5/11/2015,5,"I added lentils to this too for more protein. All the herbs, veggies and even the vinegar are from my garden. Great recipe and will make it again and again."
14410,512,12/5/2009,4,"Tried as written...mixed eggs into rice and cooked together. Made a congealed mass that looked bad but tasted good. Next time, tried cooking the eggs first to a soft scramble, then removing and adding rice to the pan. Heated rice, added egg and remaining ingredients. Daughter doesn't like hot sauce, asked for soy sauce instead and liked it very much in her thermos for school lunch. We'll definitely make this again. Final note...cheese seems unecessary, just made it more gluey."
2002238605,512,8/4/2018,0,"I agree with you about mixing eggs raw into the rice. Rice comes out too gooey. My Mom made it for breakfast when there was left over rice. That was sixty years ago when you really pinched pennies but it was so good I thought my family had extra money that week and we were having a &quot;gourmet&quot; breakfast. LOL. No need for the cheese either, just salt and pepper. I love it till this day and so will anyone with a bunch of younguns trying to make ends meet. It's not only great for breakfast but good for lunch too. Make it and you decide."
125388,512,1/1/2009,4,"Good roast with rich beefy sauce.  I probably would have preferred to thicken the sauce a little to make it more like a gravy than an ""au jus"" sauce."
64642,512,3/15/2004,4,This is a wonderful comfort food.  We also make oyster stew the same way.
282824,512,1/10/2008,5,"I am a born and bred northern New Englander and it is a pleasure to see a simple traditional Fish Chowder recipe shared that is made in the old Yankee manner without a lot of spices, etc. added.  I, my mother, grandmother and great-grandmother made/make Fish Chowder exactly as jneen has shared here.  If you want a true but simple and tasty New England flavor try this recipe."
54678,514,10/27/2008,4,The soup was good but lacking in flavour - our fish was pike which was what we had on hand.
588188,514,4/20/2013,5,"This is very much like my family&#039;s recipe, except we use salt pork cut into lardons instead of the bacon. I like to add a can of peas, or sometimes a can of cream corn as well."
305531,514,8/7/2006,5,"Very good bread.  What's not to like about bread, roasted garlic, and mushrooms! I couldn't find arugula, so we used romaine.  Our only problem was that they were hard to eat as a salad - the bread was more difficult to cut.  So we  added the lettuce on top and ate them as more of a bruschetta. Next time, I would cut the bread into cubes.  Thanks BK."
409184,517,8/5/2007,5,"Fabulous!! Loved by all. We actually ended up eating it just like lazyme, stacked on top of the bread and it was quite yummy! I know we'll be making this often. I did add one thing - before grilling the bread on the George Foreman, I brushed it lightly with fat free Italian Dressing. I just didn't like the idea of grilling it dry. I also used green leaf instead of arugula, we just can't get it here very often. Thanks for a keeper!!!"
527607,517,8/6/2007,5,"Superb!  I made this as part of a menu #8077 and it was my appetizer as i waited for the shrimp to marinate.  Really good.  I subbed cilantro for parsley because my parsley had turned off, but i think it was a great substitutions."
288218,517,3/13/2008,5,I loved it! I made it as a salad and I enjoyed so much. Arugula and mushrooms are my favorites so its balsamic. I made it as it said but next time I'll cut the bread as croutons.. Thanks so much for sharing!
89831,517,5/22/2008,5,"this is just so delicious! I omited the roasting of the garlic, I keep roasted garlic pate in my freezer, also I omitted the fresh parsley as I did not have any, I plan on growing my own soon and I do not want to purchase anymore, this salad dish has tons of flavor which is what my family loves, thanks for sharing BK!"
166642,517,6/28/2008,5,This is wonderful! This has such great flavor with ingredients I really enjoy. Yummy! Made for ZWT4 for the Tastebud Tickling Travellers.
266635,517,4/24/2015,5,"OMgoodness, this bread is absolutely delicious.  If you are a fan of roasted garlic and mushrooms, you will love this.  We did not use the arugula -- just grilled the bread and slathered it with lots of roasted garlic and then smothered the bread with mushrooms.  This recipe is going into my Best of 2015 file -- will be making this recipe again and again."
2311662,519,7/1/2012,5,"This is so fast and easy. I love it so much!! My 20 month old loves it, my husband loves it"
89831,519,8/19/2005,5,"Five stars and more for this wonderful dill dip! the only change I made was I added some fresh minced garlic into it, and doubled the recipe but kept the dill at 1 teaspoon, as I will be taking this wonderful dip over to friends tonight. Thanks for a fabulous recipe, and one that I will make again!...Kittencal:)"
192972,519,4/19/2006,5,"My hubby really liked this, and called it ""killer"".   I discovered it was wonderful with fish sticks instead of tartar sauce!!"
156034,519,4/30/2006,5,"Deely....this stuff was awesome!  Thank you for making some for our visit.
I'm going to whip up a batch tomorrow!!"
223333,519,10/31/2006,5,Wonderful. Nice change from ranch dressing. Will be making again. My hubby loved it. Gets better with time. I made mine 8 hrs in advance.
329282,519,11/26/2006,5,"I made this dip last night and it really was delicious.  I picked this recipe because I had all the ingredients on hand. Thanks for posting.  I think next time I will serve it with some rye bread, yum!!"
60992,519,5/20/2007,5,I have made dill dip this way for WELL over 30 yearas. Infact as a young girl I had it at a friends asked for the recipe and brought a new tradition into our family. You cannot have a holiday without this. Thanks for sharing THE perfect dill dip recipe.
268464,519,11/23/2007,4,Great Dip . . . perfect for veggies and chips.  Thanks for sharing.
354628,519,2/17/2008,5,"This is AWESOME! Just between my husband and I, it disappeared in two days."
452749,519,2/12/2010,5,I've made another variation of this recipe for years but decided to try yours-so glad I did!!! It was absolutely delicious!!! I've always eaten dill dip on Breton Original Crackers (sold at most grocery stores) and for some reason this dip is perfect for these crackers. I will use your recipe from now on! Thanks for sharing this!
131021,519,5/21/2010,5,"This is very similar to a dip my MIL gave me years ago, in fact she made tubs of it for our wedding. Good stuff and made with all sorts of stuff that you already have in hand. Yum."
264017,519,5/23/2010,5,"Ooh, this IS delicious! I made half the recipe just in case we didn't like it. It wasn't long after the first taste that I knew I'd be making the whole batch soon. It's so creamy and full of flavor! I used lite Hellman's and light sour cream. I had no tobasco, so I added a dash of hot sauce. Just great! Thanks Deely."
366781,519,6/19/2010,5,This was wonderful.  Not the usual dill dip so my DH loved it.  Made no changes and served it with veggies and chips.
1179225,519,10/31/2010,4,"Really good. When I make it again, I think I'll use a little less mayo. Thanks for posting the recipe."
37107,519,6/20/2011,5,"I have been making this for a couple of years and can't believe I haven't rated it yet.  This recipe is one of the easiest I've made.  The ingredients are what I usually have on hand and it goes together real fast.  I do however use chopped green onion instead of the minced onion, and I double the dried dill because I think it needs more.  Other than that, this is the veggie dip I ALWAYS go to."
32058,519,12/29/2011,5,Yum!  I halved this to see if we would like it.  I love it and it hasn't even had time to blend properly yet. Tomorrow it will be amazing I am sure and I was thrilled to have had everything on hand.
198154,519,2/2/2013,5,I used low fat mayo and sour cream and it still got 5 stars from the entire family!  I immediately added this to my cookbook. No need for all those other dill dip recipes.  This is my go to dip from now on.
550557,519,12/26/2014,5,Where has this recipe been all my life!!???
107135,519,4/2/2006,5, i love buffulo wings and this makes it easy 
53932,519,4/10/2006,5,This is a lower calorie and neater way to enjoy Buffalo chicken.  Loved the sauce.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.
33159,519,4/23/2006,5,"Very satisfying & flavourful way to do chicken - tasted just like wings!  I browned the chicken on the Foreman Grill.  I think next time, I will double the sauce so the chicken ends up saucier.  We don't care for blue cheese dressing so I just served with roasted potatoes & they were great!"
60260,519,4/26/2006,5,Everyone loved this chicken! I used Frank's Hot sauce and made the recipe as is.  I was leary of the vinegar but it worked well and I liked the addition of the celery seeds.  We made ours into Buffalo Chicken sandwiches - yum! Next time I might make just a little more sauce to add after the chicken is cooked. We are wing lovers and this sure makes getting that taste easy.
196296,519,5/25/2006,5,"This was absolutely yummy, and very easy!!!  I like that I could eat ""buffalo"" sauce without all the fat!  I made extra sauce to drizzle over the chicken when it was cooked, and I ""scored"" the chicken breasts so they would have more of the sauce on them.  Marinated them in the sauce for about 1/2 hour first.  It was a lovely warm night so I grilled them on the BBQ.  Served them with creamed spinach, which went very well with them.  Thank you Sherribabi - what a fun recipe!"
217226,519,6/29/2006,4,"All I can say about this chicken...is HOT! It was tasty and I like that it was low-calorie, but it was too much for the kids. Those who like the heat though, loved it! We served with ranch dressing instead of blue cheese, and baked as directed. "
328077,519,12/16/2006,5,Excellent dish that has become a staple in our house. Thank you.
237330,519,7/13/2006,5,"Fabulous! The taste of real wings without the mess of frying and without the ton of butter. I'll be making this often for my ""heat-seeking"" teenager. Thank you SO much! "
294700,519,8/5/2006,5,Delicious and easy!
58439,519,9/23/2006,4,"This was TERRIFIC too!
No mucking around with frying wings too!
Used Chilli Hot Sauce for quite the ZING!
For those who appreciate authentic Buffalo wings, this is the THING!"
269891,519,11/7/2006,5,"Yummy, easy, and quick. We had it with mashed potatoes, and a salad with carrots and celery topped with the blue cheese dressing"
246936,519,2/3/2007,5,Hubby adored this. Will make again!!!! Thank u so much!!!! He said if he could give it 20 stars he would!!!
355637,519,2/7/2007,4,"This was pretty tasty!!! I like hot stuff, and this wasn't really hot enough for me, but I think I will just need to find hotter sauce. My husband lives for Buffalo Wild Wings, so it was nice to have something comparable at home!! Yum and easy!!"
173314,519,2/14/2007,4,"We enjoyed this alot and I used leftover chicken by cutting up and putting in my salad with blue cheese dressing.  Might make again as a sandwich with blue cheese, lettuce, and tomato on a roll. :)"
47907,519,3/4/2007,4,We enjoyed this recipe for dinenr last night.  I made as psoted except I didn't have any celery seeds so I added some celery salt and it worked fine.  The recipe was very easy to make.  I might try and cut up the chicken into strips next time and bake them that way.  Thanks so much for posting!
280271,519,3/6/2007,5,"5 WW points!!! This is the same recipe that I have in an old 1999 weight watches cookbook called "" Cream of the Crop"" It is excellent! Nice and Hot and easy to prepare. DH and I both really enjoyed this. Thanks, Sherribabi for posting."
229850,519,3/20/2007,4,"Thought these were good, but a little too tangy. Might cut down on the vinegar next time, or leave it out. Thanx for posting."
453924,519,3/26/2007,5,"This was a HUGE hit! It was so simple to make! I doubled the sauce and before putting the chicken into the oven, I shredded it a little with two forks. I served it on toasted kaiser buns with shredded cheddar cheese, ranch dressing, lettuce, tomato, and onion. It was superb! A new favorite!"
159243,519,3/27/2007,5,This was great!  And I left out the margarine to save on calories!  It was even better the next day sliced into a salad.  Thank you!
167242,519,4/21/2007,4,"This was really good!  I used chicken tenders sauteed with a coating of garlic powder for a bit of extra flavor, and this turned out great."
361680,519,4/22/2007,5,"I loooove buffalo chicken wings, so I thought I'd give this a try. I didn't add the celery seeds, since I didn't have them on hand and it turned out great. After cooking, I let the chicken rest for a few minutes, and then I sliced it and created a deconstructed buffalo chicken wing salad. Iceburg lettuce, blue cheese dressing, carrots, celery and tomatoes and croutons. This is definitely a easy staple from now on."
369597,519,5/16/2007,5,Everyone loved it. WE had been looking for a baked version of Buffalo wings. This was great. I will make it again.
394810,519,5/24/2007,5,"This tasted just like buffalo wings.  I doubled all of the sauce ingredients, except for the margarine.  I used Frank's Hot Sauce.  DH used light ranch dressing to dip his chicken in while I ate it plain."
39301,519,9/6/2007,5,Fantastic!  I didn't change a thing and we loved this dish.  I'm sure I'll be making it frequently.  Thanks very much for posting this winner.
225179,519,10/28/2007,5,"Thanks, Sherribabi.  I've made this twice in the last week.  It's great and the leftovers make a great salad for lunch the next day."
311566,519,11/8/2007,5,Really enjoyed this... I doubled the sauce and will be making this again soon. Thanks!
537578,519,11/17/2007,5,Yum Yum Yum!!!!  Would give this 10 stars if I could!!  Didn't add the vinegar and we still loved it!  Big fans of buffalo chicken in this house.  I used a little more hot sauce and it was perfect for us!  Thanks for such a great recipe!
371738,519,11/18/2007,5,Absolutely delicious and A LOT less work than with buffalo wings.  No dressing needed.  Just the perfect kick!  Thanks.
604426,519,11/18/2007,5,"This was absolutely fantastic!!!  The marinade tasted just like the real buffalo chicken wing sauce.  I had a cocktail party, so I used boneless skinless breasts which I cut into chunks (to be picked up with toothpicks) and poured the marinade over before baking.  I also used apple cider vinegar and omitted the celery seed because we were out of them.  This was a terrific and unbelieveably easy recipe to make.  All of our guests LOVED this recipe.  Thanks so much  for submitting this.  I will be looking for more delicious recipes from you!!"
534623,519,11/25/2007,4,"This was a nice quick dinner, with pretty easy clean up. We topped ours with some shredded cheese and let it melt at the end of the baking process."
478451,519,11/26/2007,5,"This is an excellent recipe.  I asked my youngest if it was too hot for him and he said that it was a bit hot for him, but the flavour made up for the heat.  Thank you for such an easy, tasty chicken dish."
344938,520,12/3/2007,5,"This was delicious.  I used Franks Red Hot and I can't believe it's not butter... only 2 chicken breasts but kept the other ingredients the same.. I liked the extra sauce, but beware, the concentrated sauce is Salty!  It could be because of the red hot, but for whatever reason, I like salt and it was a bit overwhelming.  Love buffalo chicken but cannot stomach the skin and bone on chicken wings.  Liked others suggestion to bake more and eat leftover on a salad or even a wrap would be great!  Thanks for sharing, this ones a keeper."
226462,520,12/7/2007,5,My family loved this!  Super easy and quick to throw together after work.  Thanks for posting!
383853,520,1/14/2008,5,"I tried this recipe a long time ago and never reviewed it.  It was fantastic.  Now that I've found it again, I'm going to make it soon! I served it with ranch instead of the blue cheese.  Easy and yummy supper."
227652,520,1/15/2008,4,"My husband really enjoyed this! I made one chicken breast & cut the sauce in half, but I only used a really small amt of celery seeds, and a little less vinegar (used the cider kind) & butter. It was so easy & smelled wonderful! I served it on a bun for him, with some fat free ranch dressing. Will make it for him again!"
49561,520,1/18/2008,5,"Tried this last night and it was just yummy!  We marinated this for about Â½ hour (like someone suggested below) and did the rest of the directions.  We added some shredded mozzarella on top.  Publix has this great blue cheese dressing made with yogurt (low fat, low cal) and I poured just enough on my chicken.  We served it with Spinach & Beans #70147â€¦ what a great side with this great main dish.  Thanks!!"
497077,520,2/6/2008,5,"I love this recipe-not only because it tastes wonderful but it is sooooo easy! I wanted to serve this as an appetizer during the Super Bowl so early in the day, I browned the chicken breasts, cut into bite-size pieces, and marinated in sauce until ready to bake. Bake time was just under 20 minutes. I served w/ ranch and blue cheese dressings, celery sticks, and extra sauce. Everyone loved it especially since it was a lot easier to eat than regular buffalo wings. DH and I had leftovers the next night and they turned out great, too! Thank you for a great recipe!"
123871,520,2/7/2008,5,I made this without the celery seed. My chicken was partially frozen so my sauce was runny. I put it on the stove with flour and thickened it.I also didn't fry the chicken I put it in the oven with the sauce at 350 for an hour. This was very good and easy. Thanks!
632249,520,3/16/2008,4,"A really good easy dinner, enjoyed by all.  I made exactly as written but there is one thing I would change...next time I would bake the chicken for 15 minutes or so (after browning) and drain the grease as I found it diluted the yummy hot sauce. Overall, a great dish! Thx Sherribabi"
183817,520,3/18/2008,5,"Made this for dinner last night when I was craving buffalo wings. YUM!! Very easy to make. I followed the recipe almost exactly -- I did use  about a teaspoon of I Can't Believe It's Not Butter instead of the tablespoon of margarine. I used the thin cut chicken breasts, so they were ready at about 19 mins. Great way to get the wing flavor without the mess and fat!  Thanks."
55773,520,5/13/2008,5,"Not very hot but BIG on taste...Made it twice now...Added a splash of Worcestershire sauce...

I also sprinkled the chicken with 'Durkee Grill Creations-chicken and rib rub' prior to frying (love that stuff)...

Used 2 xtra breast halves to have leftovers for topping on a garden salad...

Cut the chicken into good sized strips so it wouldn't dry out during cooking...

This is now one of our regular menus..."
470351,520,7/5/2008,5,Holy cow!!! WONDERFUL!  Not super hot...just perfectly hot.  Not for kids probably.  We LOVED THIS!!!!  Who the heck needs fatty hot wings that are deep fried and loaded with fat when you can make this dish and it's easily just as good?  We devoured this and I had hoped for leftovers.  For the first time ever I didn't change ANYTHING!.  I guess except serving this with lite ranch vs blue cheese since I hate blue cheese. I served this with cheesy orzo and garlic artichokes...both from this site.  We are in heaven!!! Thanks for posting!
897632,520,7/20/2008,5,This recipe is definitely a keeper! As some others have suggested: you can skip the 1/2 cup fat free blue cheese dressing (approx 180cals in total) and the meal is still delicious!
440735,524,7/24/2008,4,I used Frank's hot sauce. The chicken had some zing to it. I may choose another type of hot sauce next time.  It was good and easy.
718620,524,10/5/2008,3,"this was ok, definitely not buffalo sauce though...i'll stick with the premade buffalo sauce i buy in the store - i still can't figure out what makes them different, but there is something"
284922,524,10/28/2008,5,"We enjoyed this very much!  As a big fan of Buffalo Chicken we were especially impressed with this recipe.  I think the celery seed may be a key ingredient!  I served each breast on a hamburger bun with a little lettuce, onion, and ranch (it made a great Buffalo Chicken Sandwich!) alongside a bowl of pizza soup.  Thanks so much for posting your recipe it is really fantastic and we will certainly have it again and again! :)"
354638,524,12/3/2008,5,Wow. This was absolutely amazing! The chicken was soooo incredibly moist! I served it with skillet potatoes and it was *almost* like being at buffalo wild wings! (course though - nothing beats bw's lol) - but it was AWESOME!!!!
680579,524,12/23/2008,5,Great recipe!  I will be making this regularly.  The only change I made was to double the sauce.  Thanks so much for sharing.
813470,524,8/5/2008,5,Made this with fish and was wonderful.  Very different from most veg. sides I make.  The tomatoe mixture was wonderful and loved all the cheese on top.  Also worked for the low carb diet my husband is doing...
368897,524,1/22/2009,5,"This was absolutely delicious!  I didn't have any blue cheese dressing on hand but my fiancee thought this would have been even more awesome with it, so I will make sure I have it next time.  I followed the recipe exactly, and added some low fat shredded mozzarella cheese on top before baking.  It was off the charts and it couldn't get much easier than this.  I will make this often, thank you so much for posting this recipe!!"
222433,524,2/20/2009,5,We love buffalo chicken anything at our house! Really good and easy! Thanks for a keeper Sherribabi.
353131,525,3/13/2009,5,Really great way to have buffalo chicken without all the work!
387750,526,3/23/2009,4,"This was good, but I think it would be better if the chicken was marinated in the hot sauce before it was baked, just to give it more a little more flavor. But over all it was good and I will make this again!"
169712,526,4/13/2009,4,"This was great! Instead of celery seed and pepper, I used celery salt and some smoked paprika.  I made extra sauce, which gave me plenty to marinate in--which I will do again.  (Three hours marinating seemed to do the trick) Oh, and I omitted the margarine."
344087,531,4/15/2009,5,"this is a great wat to do chicken and makes great southwestern subs with the leftovers...worthy of more than five stars. I also cook extra now for use in buffalo chicken pizzas and it freezes well so it makes a homemade pizza very handy for supper. An on another note, this makes great chicken sandwiches with chilled mayo with dry ranch mixed with it."
352814,533,4/25/2009,5,"Great recipe!  I sliced my chicken breast in half lengthwise and coated with the sauce.  I deleted the celery seed because it just didn't appeal to me.  Next time, I will probably double the sauce because I would have like a little more sauce to drizzle on top of the chicken.  Served with homemade ranch dressing.  This was delicious, thanks!"
444967,534,6/1/2009,5,"This was excellent!  I used bone in skinless breasts and scored the meat after I browned it.  Then marinated for two hours before baking. Be sure to use a nice small pan so that juices stay up around the chicken.  Served with coleslaw and celery sticks w/ranch dressing.
Oh - I also tripled the sauce.  Double probably would have been fine. Thanks MoonPoodle!"
647181,534,6/8/2009,5,I made this tonight and served it on buns as buffalo chicken sandwiches.    My fiance and I both enjoyed them.  I doubled the sauce and the only change I made was using fat free ranch instead of blue cheese.  That just happened to be what I had in the house.  We'll be putting this on our menu
846154,535,6/22/2009,5,"Yum!  Just like hot wings but without so many calories and fat!  After looking at the other reviews, I doubled my sauce and I am so glad I did!  I think next time I will cut back on the celery seed - it wasn't bad but I didn't really need that much.  Thanks for an easy, go-to dish!"
1145840,535,7/29/2009,4,"Let's see..my small changes: I didn't have celery seed (poor planning on my part) and I actually tripled the sauce.  Oh, and I had really thick chicken breasts (2 at about 1/2 lb each) so I actually cut them up into smaller pieces.  That may be why I needed extra sauce.  

This was very yummy, but I wish the sauce was a bit thicker.  I'll try to make the sauce a bit thicker next time, and maybe play around with breading the chicken.  

We served it with mashed potatoes and it was a perfect complement!"
544540,535,8/31/2009,5,Super Easy and delicious!  I love it with blue cheese and celery.
358698,535,9/3/2009,4,"This was really good - satisfied my love of buffalo wings in a healthier way.  Used my all time favorite hot sauce - Frank's.  Changes: I cut the chicken breast into strips, made double the sauce and kept some warm on the stove for serving.  Also used 1/2 the celery seeds and felt it was plenty for our tastes.  No other changes.  Next time I will try to thicken up the sauce for personal preference.  Served with ranch dressing (out of bleu cheese).  Will definitely make again.  Thanks for a keeper."
113509,536,9/25/2009,3,"This recipe didn't quite work for Hubby & I. The taste of the sauce was fine, but the sauce slides right off of the chicken. I had salted & peppered the chicken before baking it, and I was glad because that was all the flavor we had. If we did make this recipe again, I think we would either thicken the sauce with a cornstarch slurry to maybe get it to stick to the chicken, or possibly just marinate the chicken in the sauce. With a little tweaking I think this is a good recipe. Thanks for posting."
13483,536,9/30/2009,5,This was a really neat and easy recipe to do.  Not quite the messy and greasy wings   but this healther version had just as much taste.  Blue chees and hot chicken just go together very well.  So glad you posted this recipe Sherribabi
231057,536,10/7/2009,5,I loved this chicken!  Didn't use celery seed or blue cheese dressing but it was great!  Wrapped it in a tortilla with low fat mozz cheese...perfect!  Thanks for a great recipe.
189475,536,10/10/2009,5,"Excellent! I doubled all the ingredients except the chicken and celery seed and cooked it all in the crockpot. Once it was done I shredded the chicken and then let it sit for 30 more minutes to soak in the sauce. Then I mixed in more blue cheese dressing to make the sauce more creamy and less watery. I ate it like a dip and dipped tortilla chips in it. I still had some sauce left so I poured it over tortilla chips, topped with mozzarella cheese and melted the cheese in the microwave for 40 seconds. Thank you for sharing this recipe!"
85018,536,10/13/2009,5,"Great and so simple and easy.  Uses things always in the pantry!  Only thing different, we used lite Ranch dressing!  Gonna try AmandaMcG's idea and make these into sandwiches!  Thanks for the recipe--it'll be well used here!"
227607,536,10/14/2009,5,"This was one of those recipes that the whole family loved(2 adults and 5 children).  I soaked the chicken in ranch before browning.  I tried to coat a few in flour before browning but it did not make it any better so I did not do it on most of them.  I doubled the recipe.  We just had this with celery, carrots, cheese and tomatoes with ranch dressing on the side.  I have used the leftovers 2 days for sandwiches for lunch.  This is an easy and wonderful recipe."
1336278,536,10/27/2009,5,"This is very good. 

One note- DON'T leave out the celery seed. I hate celery itself but the seeds really 'make' this dish. My roomate is a really picky eater and even he likes celery seed now."
1245777,536,10/30/2009,5,I love chicken wings buy my husband doesn't like to eat things that have bones in them.  So I really wanted buffalo chicken wings and found this receipe.  It was amazing.   The chicken came out very tender.
1442937,536,11/10/2009,0,Soooo good.  Im so happy to have found this recipe.  My 7 year old son is the pickiest little eater but he ate a whole chicken breast and asked for seconds.  My family was so pleasantly suprised that baked buffalo chicken could taste so much like real fried buffalo chicken...in my opinion even better!  Thanks!
1348891,536,11/13/2009,5,"I made this last night. It was hottt!! Very good. My hubbie loved it, he couldn't stop talking about how great the meal was. We love going to Hooters or Buffalo Wild Wings and since money is a little tight with the holidays coming, this hit the spot. Thanks for posting!!"
106614,536,11/15/2009,5,"Wowza!  DH and I love, love spicy food and I figured this would be on the mark, but WOW.  Still trying to figure out how this combination results in such a HOT sauce.  Loved it.  Served w/ blue cheese dressing, roasted potatoes.  WONDERFUL."
1179225,536,11/21/2009,4,Really good! Next time I'll make a little more sauce. Thanks for posting.
1466118,536,12/4/2009,4,"I decided to not cook chicken before.. thought it would be easier, I think you definitely need to, or the sauce is too runny-  I added paperika and garlic powder to the hotsauce because a place near me makes their chicken wing sauce with it...it adds good flavor... good substitute for fried wings"
229787,536,12/13/2009,5,"This is a very good recipe that I have been meaning to rate since I have made it 3 times already. :) The first time I made this I went exactly as the recipe says...Everyone liked it..I however did not like the celery seed...so the times after I made it I left out the celery seed and loved it! (no one even noticed) =) 
This is actually on my menu for dinner this week...I too doubled up on the sauce! I use Frank's Hot Wing Buffalo sauce...only because we like the taste of it better and it's a bit thicker.
Great easy recipe! Thanks for sharing!"
178742,536,12/23/2009,5,"This was sooooo good! I followed directions exactly. The only thing I did differently was double the sauce! We loved it, it tasted just like our local wing place Roosters. Next time I think I will do chicken breast strips/tenders.
Thanks for an awesome recipe!"
1168372,536,1/10/2010,5,"This  is the 2nd time I've made this dish, and forgot to rate it.  It is an excellent dish, as long as you like the hot sauce.   Thanks for a great recipe."
448338,536,1/21/2010,5,"This was great!  I had about 4 med-large sized chicken breasts so I kept everything the same except tripled the hot sauce and left out the blue cheese.  Also, instead of browning in skillet, I drizzled chicken w/olive oil, seasoned w/Grill Mates Montreal Chicken Seasoning and threw it on the foreman grill for a few minutes.  Poured the sauce over then finished in the oven at 375 for about 15-20 minutes.  Sprinkled w/monteray jack cheese and served on a toasted wheat bun. Very yummy!!"
693482,536,2/7/2010,4,"I thought the flavor was fine with these, but it doesn't ""hit the spot"" if you're looking for buffalo wings. Without the crispy coating and thick sauce, it's just not buffalo to me. If you don't mind going without those things, though, this is the recipe for you!"
1526284,536,2/26/2010,4,"Very good!  The sauce has just the right amount of heat from the hot sauce.  

People should know that this is not a thick sauce that clings but rather a thin one.  Also, it does not have the exact flavor of classic/traditional/original Buffalo sauce.

The sauce does have a little too much celery seed for my taste, so next time I will decrease it and I will also add some salt to it."
166294,536,4/19/2010,4,"We really enjoyed this dish tonight.  I didn't realize the sauce would be so thin so that's why I only gave it 4 stars.  We added extra hot sauce and served it with the fat free blue cheese (didn't think I'd like that, but I did) and it was a lovely dinner.  I served it with sauteed zucchini and creamy rice.  Thanks!"
951955,536,5/22/2010,5,"awesome! I noticed the sauce was a little thin, so when the chicken was done I took them  out, put the sauce back in the frying pan and reduced it. It thickened up and tasted great, had to add a teaspoon of margarine to it. Thanks for the great recipe :)"
1017863,536,1/14/2011,5,"This combination of flavors was great. I did season the chicken evenly on both sides with (Sazon Goya Picante) which has Habanero and Guajillo chiles seasoning. I also duplicated the recipe since I made a lot more chicken. I used Franks red hot extra hot sauce and buffalo wing sauce. The sauce was thin but I let it seat in the oven a few more minutes to thickened up a little more. The left over sauce we saved and used it the next day on Skirt steak, also added sauce to egg salad and it was wonderful. Thanks for this great recipe.  :~)"
1016620,536,2/1/2011,4,"Being from Buffalo, I am very picky about my wings. While this recipe will never replace wings, I think it is a good recipe when you want something spicy and can't get out to get wings. I think that if i were to make it again, i would leave out the celery seed, at least on mine, my hubby liked the celery seed."
21752,536,11/1/2007,5,"As the recipe states, this is perfect for the weekday. I used a local fish called Nile perch and cut it up into serving-size fillets.  The mayo kept the fish lovely and moist.  We had this with baked potatoes and a simple Israeli salad, and for a Wednesday night, it was perfect!"
1898667,536,5/1/2011,5,"I made this last night and it was delicious! I, too, used Frank's brand buffalo sauce (every restaurant I've ever worked at or loved the wings from uses Frank's!). I didn't have celery salt so I skipped it but I'll try it next time. I had chicken breast cutlets so I used those and they came out so flavorful and moist. Few things: I dredged the chicken in flour before I browned it to give it a slight coating, I used REAL butter (because I think margarine is a joke), I used more sauce (enough to really coat both sides of all 8 of my cutlets), and I sprinkled them with sesame seeds (just because I see a lot of places do this with their wings so it seemed like a good idea!). Thanks for a great recipe that made my new husband think I'm some sort of a good cook!"
1723464,536,8/21/2011,4,"A very easy and tasty recipe!  I did double the sauce as recommended by many, and agree that the amount of celery seed should be reduced.  Next time I'm going to adjust by cutting the celery seed in half, reducing the hot sauce by 25% and replacing with some Durkey sauce."
244264,536,8/26/2011,5,I've made this about three times in the last few weeks and we love it. Frank's Hot Buffalo sauce has a little more heat in it and that was our favorite.  I think I'll make it again tonight...
928301,536,11/3/2011,4,"Tastes good.  Following the advice of other reviewers, I doubled the sauce recipe but only used one serving of celery seed.  I also added a measure of garlic powder and paprika & I used Louisianna Hot Sauce.  I coated my chicken with flour before putting on the stove.  I didn't have to pound it & it baked to a nice juicy doneness.  I put the sauce on the stove a bit to thicken it afterward."
369715,536,11/15/2011,4,This was good and easy to make. I doubled the sauce based on the other reviews but didn't double the celery seed. I actually didn't eat this because I don't eat hot wings but the rest of the family enjoyed this. Hubby said it was really spicy but the sauce was thin.
1624417,536,12/15/2011,0,"Delicious but not too spicy. I doubled the sauce and dredged the chicken in flour before frying. I deglazed the pan with the sauce after pouring out the excess oil from frying. Pour the sauce slowly because it will spatter at first. Pour the sauce over the chicken and bake. I did not add the vinegar, pepper or celery seeds; served it with blue cheese dressing and tater rounds. Celery sticks dipped in dressing rounded out the meal."
2209213,536,3/19/2012,5,"I made this Sat nite because hubby was craving ""bar food"".  He said it's a keeper!  Followed recipe except celery salt.  I also doubled the sauce as others advised.  Frank's now has a ""thick"" version of their sauce and that's what I used.  Will definitely make again!"
2324285,536,11/25/2012,4,"This is a good chicken breast recipe, but unfortunately the buffalo sauce doesn't cling to the chicken, so my buffalo chicken sandwiches tasted pretty bland.  I had to dip it in the sauce.  I think it would've tasted better just on the plate with the sauce over it.  Thanks for sharing."
293757,536,12/5/2013,5,"I really enjoyed this recipe, so I will be making again only change I would do is doubling the sauce, but other than that it was yyuummmmyyy, thanks again for the fab post!!!!"
1098736,536,7/3/2014,4,Followed previous suggestions and dredged the chicken alomg with this and it was AWESOME! thanks!
1862990,536,9/16/2014,5,"I like *hot* to a small degree, so I actually used half hot sauce and half ketchup to tone down the heat, but the result was quite delicious ... this is a quick and easy recipe that my family really enjoyed. I&#039;ll definitely make it again!"
1803173435,536,9/27/2014,5,"So, I made this and totally misread the instructions and ended up adding the salad dressing to the mix that was poured over the chicken!  I don&#039;t like Blue Cheese, so I used light Ranch.  The verdict....AMAZING...and not at all too thin.  I spooned it over some brown rice; it had a marsala or curry-like feel to the dish.  It definitely makes too much more sauce, but it was so good nonetheless.  I kept repeating to myself: &quot;I hope it doesn&#039;t burn&quot;.  Luckily, it didn&#039;t!"
2000719677,536,12/6/2015,4,We didn&#039;t even bake them and they turned out great!
2000837459,536,1/24/2016,5,This was delicious! I eat low carb high fat and this was the best. Even my family liked it.
2000870186,536,2/11/2016,5,"I&#039;ve made this quite a few times now and it has become of a family favorite. I dredge the chicken breasts in flour (seasoned with a little salt, pepper, and garlic powder) and brown them. I also double the sauce...I use Frank&#039;s and don&#039;t add the celery seed. So good!!!"
310001,536,8/12/2016,5,"I tried this today, minus the celery seed, added minced garlic. I only had thinly sliced, boneless, skinless chicken breast on hand, so used that. I loved it, and will try it again using different hot sauces (we have at least a dozen kinds in the pantry b/c of DH). DH enjoyed it, as well as my younger son (dipped in blue cheese of course). Thank you for an easy, delicious recipe. Perhaps I'll put thin slices of swiss or provolone on top of it next time, at the end, just long enough to melt but not burn."
2574795,536,12/31/2016,3,"Good but I think these buffalo chicken breasts are better grilled - slightly brown on each side and then baste generously with sauce turning once or twice until cooked through. But, this is a good substitute for nights when firing up the grill would not be optimal. Made several tweaks. Also recommend keeping some sauce on the side for dipping."
2001382107,536,2/7/2017,4,"I made this tonight but I put my own spin on it. I took someones advice from the reviews below and I seasoned the chicken with garlic salt and pepper then drenched it in flour sauteed for a few min on each side in real butter. I put the chicken in a pan and covered it in a mix of buffalo sauce, ranch, and parmesan cheese. Topped it with monterey cheese (or mozarella) baked at 400 for 20min covered with foil. It was AMAZING! The whole family loved it! Not too spicy for the kids either. I didnt use celery seed or vinegar at all jist because i didnt have them in the pantry."
2001461276,536,3/28/2017,0,"I've made this twice. Used Franks, a bit of Worcester and some red wine vinegar. Only 3 breasts, as this is for 2! Add a side of Mrs.Tt's Pierogies and a salad ... Great Meal! Will make again and may also change the ingredients! I love experimenting with flavors."
894666,536,5/3/2017,5,"So easy and so quick to put together! Just pan-fried the flour/salt/peppper coated chicken in a T of butter. Mixed the sauce together (used ranch instead of blue cheese, didn't use the T of butter in sauce or the celery seed.) Drizzled a light coating of sauce on each side of chicken when it was almost done and let it cook another minute or so. That was it!! So easy!!!! Served it with butter noodles, salad and watermelon. So flavorful!"
51501,536,3/7/2007,4,"These were sooooo easy and delicious! Chef#319903, you were right....these do go quickly!!"
651269,536,6/22/2008,4,Great! Icing is delicious.
634323,536,9/7/2008,5,These were really yummy & so fast to  make.  The most surprising part was the icing.  I have looked for a while for good tasting icings that don't have butter or shortening.  This is the best I have tried.
375987,536,12/19/2006,5,really simple to make and delicious with caribbean style curries.
582561,536,10/15/2012,3,"Didn't quite make the grade for me and DH.  The sauce seemed to be a bit too on the dry side (may be my tomatoes weren't big enough) and while I enjoy chilies, they didn't really work with the flavour combinations.  MAde for PaC Fall 2012."
540605,536,2/27/2010,5,"These nachos were sexy! I added a can of black beans, rinsed, to add more color and because I love beans on nachos."
8688,536,7/4/2007,5,"We love marinated cucumbers during the summertime, and this recipe is no exception.  This is a delicious and fresh tasting salad which goes well with any summertime meal.  Thanks for sharing, CulinaryQueen : )"
226066,536,10/21/2007,5,Used an English cucumber and drained it for about an hour.  The cucumber was so crunchy and tasty!  Added about 1 tablespoon of sugar.  Lots of pepper.  Couldn't find fresh dill so used dried.  Thanks CulinaryQueen!
80353,536,10/28/2007,5,"Very tasty and refreshing salad.  I only ended up using half the amount of sugar called for and it was sweet enough for our tastes.  The dill is a great addition, complementing the crispy-crunchy blandness of the cucumber.  Highly recommended."
486725,536,12/30/2007,4,"I really liked the dill in this. I halved the vinegar and only used 1/4 tsp of the sugar, so it wouldn't be too sweet (both were still plenty for us). Served 4 as a main side vegetable dish."
963505,536,10/15/2008,5,Nice refreshing salad! I used less than a half the sugar and came out great! Thank you!
738401,536,6/7/2009,5,"Boy do we LOVE this at our house!  I have made it dozens of times with the following adjustments:  first, I do PEEL the cucumbers and slice them with a mandoline, second I let them sit about an hour in the salt to drain off maximum moisture.  Also,  I use dried dill.  This salad is super.  Thanks."
207176,536,10/19/2007,0,"So glad you posted this!  I had ripped it from Bon Apetit magazine, July, 2007. I like the tip that says you can keep it warm in a fondue pot"
538524,536,5/12/2008,5,"i wanted to make this for mothers day because we had the whole family over for a carne asada! and wow was this a hit! everybody thought it was amazing! we weren't able to find the poblano chiles at the store, but its okay cause some of my family can't handle spice very well. it was great without em and we all gobbled this allllll up! pretty easy to make too!!! great recipe!"
1675225,536,4/19/2015,2,"I used thawed frozen flounder , and my fish turned out mushy, not crispy.  Didn&#039;t like the flavor either.  Won&#039;t use this recipe again."
375111,536,11/28/2008,4,"I took this to a pre-holiday party and I thought it was very tasty...but the guys LOVED it!!!  Many raves from them.  It is a little time consuming, but not hard.  Just make sure to give yoourself plenty of time to get all the different items prepped first, it would have been a little less stressful if I had done that:)  I also put it in a fondue pot to keep warm-thanks for the tip!"
571739,536,8/8/2010,4,"If I could I'd probably give this 3.5 stars as written, but my husband loved it so I bumped it up.  I made a half batch and it was about and inch deep in a standard pie plate to give you an idea of quantity.  I was expecting better flavor but I found it lacking.  I think I'll make it again but instead of the mozzarella I'd use a stronger flavored cheese...not sure what yet but it was a little bland.  I think I'll also use a full flavored Mexican beer instead of the chicken stock as well.  I popped it under the broiler for a few minutes to get it good and bubbly, but it still firmed up quickly and was difficult to eat after 15 minutes, so I'll use my fondue pot next time to keep it warm."
356062,536,9/1/2007,5,"I loooooove garlic, so this recipe was great for me since I used a garlic pesto and used a few cloves of roasted garlic mixed into the final product. Excellent fast and tasty side!"
293410,536,9/9/2007,5,"Really glad I chose this for tag! I used my Winter Pesto which has tons of parsley, so didn't need to add any more. I bet it would be amazing with basil pesto. Next time I think I'll use more than 1 clove (garlic fiend here *sigh*). This is a terrific basic recipe that is open to variations. Thanks for posting!"
470351,536,9/20/2008,4,"This was really tasty...but I was the only one in the family who liked it.  I didn't use homemade pesto since we're recovering from Hurricane Ike and my frozen batch of pesto melted during the power outage.  used Trader Joe's brand and while I enjoyed it, I will try it again with homemade.  I Love cannellini beans, garlic and onions.  This was a nice side dish for me.  Thank you!"
96177,536,1/10/2009,5,"Great cannellini recipe. I used my frozen home grown cannellini's from last summer's garden and served it cold for lunch. Nice blend of flavors, love pesto and garlic and beans. I added the leftovers to recipe #348260. tagged in 123."
58931,536,5/1/2009,5,"I made these with what I had on had, which was Great Northern beans and no parsley.  In a word: fabulous.  Thank you!"
2674680,539,3/2/2014,4,This was very fast and easy to make. I sauteed a chopped shallot instead of the onion and used 3 garlic cloves. Didn&#039;t have any parsley. I toasted some crusty bread and then slathered the bean mix on top of it and ate it as an open-faced sandwich.
2000322630,540,2/5/2017,4,"Like another reviewer, I used Great Northern beans and no parsley. It was very tasty and easy to make! I used store bought pesto."
131674,540,10/22/2007,5,These were rich and fudgy.  I baked them for 25 minutes and they came out perfect.  I sprinkled the half the top with walnuts and left the other half plain.
305531,540,12/23/2007,5,"Wonderful! I'm not a baker at all and these were so simple and easy even for me, lol. They are so rich, moist, and fudgy. Yum. I added walnuts and my family devoured these. Thanks Lynn for making me look so good."
52282,540,12/27/2007,3,"next time i will make these in 2 8x8"" pand so they cook through. my oven might be off, but i had to bake for 35 minutes and the center was still totally wet.
you didn't mention cooking temp, so i checked my basic ""how to cook everything"" cookbook by mark bittman who had this exact recipe in half and recommended 350."
50969,543,1/31/2008,4,"I made these on 1/31/08 for ""Comfort Food Photos 2008"" .The taste was good,but not as fudgy as I would have liked.And I don't know if baking them at 25 minutes instead of 20 had anything to do with them being dry.But thanks for posting,and ""Keep Smiling :)"""
37636,543,4/27/2008,4,Very good brownies!!! I baked mine for 25 minutes as you suggested might be a good time to check again. They came out a cross between chewy and cakelike brownies which might please everyone regardless of preference. I put finely chopped pecans in mine. They won't last long here!!! Thanks for the recipe. ~Lorie
56003,543,1/17/2010,4,"Very good brownies, Lynn.  I cut the recipe in half and baked for 20 minutes in a disposable brownie pan.  Came out nice and moist, just like I like them.  Thnx for sharing!  Made for Comfort Cafe Snow Queen Chalet Jan 2010."
2549237,543,5/9/2014,5,"These were very good.  I made 20 batches to take to a bake sale at my kid&#039;s school in my Perfect Brownie Pan and they were all gone within about 15 minutes.  I had three ladies come and ask me for the recipe and I emailed this pages link when I got home, so hopefully you will be getting a bunch more reviews.  These were definitely very fudgy and delicious.  I can see this being whipped up quite often when we want a chocolate fix as they were simple and delicious.  Thank you so much Lavender Lynn.  Made for PAC Spring 2014."
299849,543,4/18/2009,4,"Very tasty.  The tortillas turned to mush in the oven though and I don't know why.  I wonder if I didn't cook them long enough (in the Pam) or if I could have tried some crunchy chips instead.  

What a great recipe to use up rotisserie chicken!!!!!  I will try cooking the tortillas longer next time."
107135,543,6/22/2010,5,ok this is really good  sorry i havent gotten around to reviewing you lol  nice dish   zingo tour 6 i used my greek spice recipe for this
498271,543,6/22/2010,5,"Boy this was really good!  I don't care for onions so left them out, and left out the feta to keep the calories down a bit.  I love Cavenders - who knew it would taste so great in eggs?!  This makes a great breakfast that I will definitely make again - thanks for sharing the recipe!  Made for ZWT6, Zwizzle Chicks"
80353,543,6/23/2010,5,"Took a bit of licence with this recipe - used full-fat feta and regular tomatoes, which I didn't feel compromised the recipe any.  I don't know what Cavender's greek seasoning is, so I just used a pinch each of oregano and basil (a little more generous on the oregano) as well as salt and pepper.  The kids and I really enjoyed this wrap for our breakfast - tasty and filling and fast.  Thanks."
28177,543,6/27/2010,5,"I guessed that the black olives were Greek Kalamata, which I had on hand, so I used those.  DS & I looked everywhere for the Cavenders A/P Greek Seasoning without any luck.  Never heard of the brand even, so maybe something we don't get in this area.  We settled on a seasoning mix that had a great many traditional Greek herbs in it.  Other than that, made as directed.  Even my kalamata-hating family enjoyed them in this wrap.  I loved that it was mostly vegetables and we didn't miss the breakfast sausage because it was so flavorful.  Thanks for sharing your creation, Shuz!  Made & enjoyed for ZWT-6 Team Xtra Hot Dishes! :D"
228458,543,6/27/2010,5,"Mmmm, this made for such a delicious lunch! I used green onions because I had them on hand, and only one egg for my wrap. I loved the crunch of the veggies with the soft egg and smooth cheese...yum! I might have gone a bit light on the Cavender's (didn't really measure as I was cooking for one) so next time I'll be sure to use it all! Thanks for posting! Made for ZWT 6, Team Mischief Makers."
56003,543,6/27/2010,5,"What a great b'fast this made!  I had some beautiful Whole Wheat & Flax low-fat wrappers I had gotten at the store some time ago.  I guess I was just waiting to use them with this recipe.  Thnx so much for sharing your recipe, Shuzbud.  Made for the Voracious Vagabonds of ZWT 6."
171790,543,6/28/2010,5,Yummy. I'm having one of these for my lunch as I type. Like a previous reviewer I used whole wheat & flax tortillas. I had to leave out the zucchini since I didn't have any and I used campari tomatoes which are a little larger than cherry tomatoes. I also used a different brand of Greek seasoning and green olives rather than black since that's what we usually have on hand (family prefers green over black olives). Made for ZWT6 ZINGO
192581,543,6/30/2010,5,"Great recipe.  I used an improvised Greek seasoning mix, using garlic, oregano, lemon, basil, black pepper, etc.  Egg to veggie ratio was just perfect.  I used about 1/4 cup feta cheese for the whole recipe, and kalamata olives.  We ate this as a main veggie meal with a veggie side.  Next time, I might make sure to try to make this warmer, by warming the tortillas.   Either way, a definite keeper and make again meal!  We were both pleased!  Thanks so much :)"
527607,543,7/1/2010,5,"Had these when a friend and her daughter were over, they were a big hit!"
428885,543,7/2/2010,5,"Shuz, a perfect taste for a Sunday morning on the farm. Loved the greek seasoning coupled with the eggs and the tortilla. I warmed my tortilla and the eggs almost melted into the tortilla it was so good!! made for ZWT 6"
169430,543,10/19/2010,5,"You really have a winner here. I made it using Recipe#81283 (which is fabulous) and using the feta. It's a wonderful flavor experience and made a perfect lunch. I see that some reviewers have mentioned warming the tortillas, I always warm them for a few seconds in the microwave because they are so much more compliant about being wrapped. I used kalamata olives and what else can I say except Yumm!"
424680,544,1/16/2012,5,"Followed your recipe right on down (my other half wouldn't have let me omit the feta!), & filled 4 tortillas right up for a very delicious wrap! No need for warming the soft tortillas I use as they are ALWAYS soft, but maybe that's also because we go through so many of 'em! Wonderful recipe! [Made & reviewed in the current ADOPT A TAG event]"
2001327157,544,12/29/2016,5,"No Greek seasoning at my supermarket, so used 1 tsp oregano, 1/2 tsp basil, 1/2 tsp garlic powder, 1/2 tsp salt. Also added about 1/4 cup fresh parsley. Amazing flavor! Adding to the dinner rotation."
2876642,544,11/17/2014,5,Really simple and delicious!  I use this recipe whenever I don&#039;t feel like doing much work for vegetables -and it&#039;s still very yummy!
2177426,544,2/3/2018,5,"So simple and so good! I used pink salt, just because....LOL. The temp. and timing are perfect. Thank you Martha"
2708004,544,3/21/2014,5,EVERYONE loved this salad!  It was so easy and so different.  I will definitely be making this again (and again!).
646967,544,6/9/2008,3,These are easy to make however they never set up so we could eat them!  They tasted great but had to be eaten with a fork!  I am wondering if you need to let it boil before removing from heat so they will harden -?-
574031,544,8/10/2010,5,"This is a fabulous recipe!  I had a hard time getting them to not fall apart when dropping them, so the second time I put it into a cake pan and chilled.  Everyone loved these cookies/bars."
18660,544,11/2/2001,5,"The combination of crescent rolls and savory chicken filling was delicious. If you ever want to jazz up a chicken salad sandwich, this filling would go well on any type of bread. The ingredients blend well together. I used low fat canned chcicken as a time saver and reduced fat cream cheese and reduced fat crescent rolls to save on calories. Would go well with a salad."
23139,544,1/23/2002,0,"My grandmother used to make these! I use her recipe which is the same except no olives. She used to also use tuna sometimes instead of chicken, omit the salt if you do use tuna. I sometimes use different flavored croutons..such as ranch,or garlic and onion-gives it a little kick."
37215,546,4/12/2002,5,"These were delicious and dissappeared quickly.  I used about 1/3 cup of mushrooms instead of the olives.  I had quite alot of filling left though  so I made some pastry, cut into rounds, spooned on the mixture, folded in half and crimped the edges with a fork. They turned out great too!"
30298,546,8/27/2002,4,"This was good!  My husband loved it.  I added more onions than were called for, and will probably take Clarebears advice for added mushrooms next time, just to give it a little something extra.  I used reduced fat rolls and light cream cheese as well, and do not think this detracted from a great meal!"
49126,546,10/26/2002,5,"I tried this one with fat free cream cheese, pre-made biscuit dough, celery, mushrooms, onions, and chicken.  Delicious!  Thanks for an easy alternative to a box dinner.  Leftovers kept well, and were great nuked! "
65765,546,12/28/2002,5,"I LOVE chicken squares!  They are my favorite dish!  I boil the chicken and then put it in the food processor with the cream cheese, butter, and chives.  It's a creamier consistency than if you cut up the chicken.  And then pour some cream of mushroom soup over the top of it, MMM.  You will LOVE this stuff!  Chicken rice is a good side dish to serve with it too.  Also, I find that it is just as tasty if you use low-fat cream cheese and low-fat crescent rolls.  However, if you use the low-fat crescent rolls, be sure to grease the pan!"
58407,547,4/16/2003,4,"I love these! I have this same exact recipe, but I add one tablespoon of pimento to the chicken filling."
86627,547,8/25/2003,5,"My kids loved these! That says alot.  My oldest kept raving about them...even hubby said.. you know... you could use same concept and make pizza or hamburger ""hot-pockets""... Thanks for posting. We'll make these again and will play with the fillings for variety."
56181,548,11/10/2003,5,"These are so easy and good!  I made them a little different by pressing 4 of the crescent rolls into the bottom of a greased 8x8 pan, putting the fillling on top, and then putting the remaining 4 crescent on top of that, and finally sprinkling the croutons(about 1/2 cup) over it!  Hubby and I both loved these!  Thanks for the great recipe, Lauren!  Will definitely be making these again!"
50411,548,1/22/2004,5,"Excellent!! The only change I made was using garlic butter in place of regular butter, and they were superb!!  My 6 year old son snarfed his down, and he doesn't even like cream cheese, so that just shows how well all the flavors in the filling blend together.  Very simple, very tasty, and will be made time and time again in our house. Thanks for sharing. "
117776,548,3/15/2004,5,"These were a big hit with my kids!  There was plenty of filling so I used 2 pkgs of rolls.  I also just folded them over to make squares instead of pulling up the corners.  They were like hot pockets.  Of course I had to omit the olives so my kids would even try them. I'll be making these again, thanks!!"
27744,548,3/16/2004,5,"I really loved this.  I did make a few changes...chopped fresh mushrooms instead of olives, half-n-half instead of milk and I added a little fresh parmesan.  The family loved it.  It'll be in the rotation from now on. Thanks!"
60992,548,4/12/2004,5,What a great way to use leftover poultry! I used turkey and per the other review added 1 T. diced roasted red pepper. I couldn't resist adding 1/4 c. shredded sharp cheddar (but next time I will add more)to the filling mixture. The packets go together beautifully and the buttery crushed croutons on top and a great flavor dimension to the recipe. My husband adored them and so did I.
250238,548,2/18/2007,4,These were rather plain.  I think some addition of red pepper or spice of some kind may have gone a long way in helping them out.  The pastry/crust was perfect.  They just need some tweaking to the filling.  Don't be scared to try them...just do your best to kick them up a notch!
55729,548,4/17/2004,5,"This wasn't the exact recipe I was looking for, but I think I can comfortably stop looking. It was easy and yummy, and I had 0 complaints. I didn't have any croutons so I used bread crumbs instead, and 3/4 c. would certainly have been overkill - I only used about 2 T, and I think I'll skip it next time, but will still brush with butter. I used 4oz cream cheese, and didn't add olives."
180037,548,1/5/2005,5,"I have been making this recipe since it won the 1974 Pillsbury Bake-off.  My family insists that no Thanksgiving weekend in our house is complete without using some leftover turkey to make this dish!  Usually I stick to the basic recipe (at the insistance of my family) but I recently had some mild goat cheese that I wanted to use up.  I mixed it with a little chutney and the chicken as the filling.  With some additional chutney on the side, it was quite tasty."
98165,548,2/10/2005,5,Thsee are excellant and so easy. My family loves these and are always so excited when they see me making them.  Thanks again!
104472,548,5/9/2005,5,This recipe is great. I used crushed ritz crackers instead of bread crumbs to make it more kid friendly so my boys would eat it. My dh isalways impressed with this meal - A+
37449,548,7/31/2005,5,"I made this for my husband for dinner tonight and he loved it! I left out the olives, and used scallions. Thanks for an easy meal!"
68884,548,9/12/2005,5,"Wow, I got raves when I served these to friends for a casual dinner . I tripled the recipe to make 12 bundles and added 2 cloves of garlic and about a cup of shredded cheddar. I didn't use the full amount of crushed croutons - I don't know why, but it didn't 'stick' to the bundles like I thought. These would be so versatile to get some veggies in - finely chopped celery & carrots or mushrooms & broccoli would go great in these. I used light cream cheese and light crescent rolls with no compromise to the taste. Thanks :) "
72243,548,9/13/2005,5,"This is a wonderful recipe.  Every time I visit my mother, she requests I make these for her!!"
31499,548,9/16/2005,5,"Super easy recipe that makes a nice presentation, and tastes just great. I brushed the tops with EVOO instead of butter, but otherwise followed this exactly. Really different recipe that I will definately make again."
120843,548,9/19/2005,5,"Very good!  My 5 y/o nephew and I made these Saturday night and he gave them a ""thumbs up""  I did ""divide"" the mixture and add some canned artichokes to my half~I used Bratty's advice and brushed the tops with olive oil & Michelle's advice and added 1/4 C. shredded cheese-the results were perfect. Thanks for sharing!"
51011,548,9/24/2005,5,"Easy and quick to put together!  I used 2 oz of cream cheese, green onions, and 1/4 a cup of cheddar cheese along with all the other ingredients.  I also forgot about putting the toping on, but the top was still golden and crunchy.  Thanks so much for sharing!"
103876,548,9/25/2005,5,I made this recipe for lunch today because I had all the ingredients on hand.  I thought it was really good and my family enjoyed it too.  I used light cream cheese and only 1 tablespoon of butter.  The croutons added a nice crunch.
64583,548,1/19/2006,4,These were good and the leftovers reheated very well in the oven the next day.  
177933,548,2/14/2006,5,These were so easy and yummy.  My husband loved them.  I added a handful of peas.  Thanks!!
39301,548,10/14/2006,5,"Easy, flavorful and inexpensive...  A triple threat!  Thanks for sharing this great recipe.  Will definitely make it again.  I omitted the olives as a matter of personal taste, otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  The filling possibilities are endless, though!"
183798,548,12/14/2006,5,"This was so good!  It looked like it came out a box (it was that perfect) and tasted like I slaved in the kitchen all day!!!  I made it with fresh boneless, skinless chicken thighs.  Thanks so much for this delish recipe.  Next time I might add some mushrooms (and believe me, there will be a next time and a next time - MANY more times!!! LOL)"
425105,551,1/8/2007,5,"I got this same recipe from a good friend years ago. It's always wonderful. Her recipe called for optional pimento instead of olives, but I always left that out because I don't care for it. Her recipe also uses chives instead of onions. I usually use bread crumbs instead of croutons. I've also made this with the lowfat crescent rolls, and it comes out just as good."
418071,555,1/23/2007,5,"I got this recipe off of the pillsbury site, and it was absolutely amazing.  It was easy and looked like it took hours to make in the kitchen."
111291,555,3/23/2007,5,"A five star recipe.  Found this while I was ""surfing"" RecipeZaar. Thought if I didn't find it, I'd post it. This has been a ""regular"" in my home for years.  My recipe omits the olives and croutons.  Great served with a side of carrots and peas.  Thanks for sharing!!"
461156,556,3/23/2007,5,These are perfect. Only thing I added  was garlic salt. My picky 6 year old said this is her favorite now! Thank you!!
357723,556,3/25/2007,5,"These were fabulous. I made them exactly as directed and doubled the recipe. The only thing different is that I added garlic. VERY delicious, easy to make. Thank you Lali!"
173314,556,3/26/2007,5,These have always been a favorite of mine and often serve when having a friend over for lunch...everyone loves this!
171790,556,5/9/2007,5,These are really good. I first made them back in the 70's when my MIL and I found the recipe in a magazine.
480441,556,5/9/2007,5,"wasn't real sure as I was preparing these,but to my surprise they were absolutely delicious....I'll definitely will make these again..thanks"
315055,556,5/18/2007,4,"Looked really nice put together and perfect size for to take to lunch, but the filling was a little bland"
452210,556,6/23/2007,3,"These were really good. I had a pretty hard time getting the first few to close up, but I got the hang of it. I gave up on trying to do the small version, but I manage a little better with the larger version. Very yummy!"
501437,556,6/28/2007,5,"My family loved these! I left out olives, and added a little bit of shredded cheddar and it was a hit. These reheat surpsisingly well also."
166294,556,9/4/2007,5,"We really enjoyed these.  It was like warm chicken salad in a pastry.  Yum!  My kids wanted more than I actually made.  Gotta love when that happens.  I even got the comment, ""Mom, you're such a good cooker.""  Thanks for posting!"
407007,556,9/26/2007,5,"if I could give you 50 stars, I would -- this was absolutely wonderful!!! my house smelled so delish while these cooked and the taste did not disappoint! would not change a thing. perfect recipe. thanks for sharing it!"
363962,556,11/16/2007,5,"This is pretty good, and easy to make, next time i 'm going to take one of reviewers suggestion and make mini size ones for an appetizer, Thanks for recipe Lali."
375111,556,11/26/2007,5,I made the appetizer version of these for a cocktail party and they were great!  I followed another reviewer and used 1/3 less fat crm. cheese and it tasted just fine that way.  I used a rotisserie chicken from the deli since I was short on cooking time and I can't stand canned chicken and I think that added to the flavor a lot!  I omitted the olives since I din't have any and added 1 can mushroom pieces b/c I did have that.  Made into small squares and brushed with butter and sprinkled on seasoned bread crumbs.  Love them!  Thanks so much!!
672478,557,6/25/2008,5,"I made these for a get-together and everyone loved these.  I didn't have any left over.  It did make six squares, thankfully I had two cans of crescent rolls. I'll increase the ingredients very sligthtly so that I can make 8 (for 2 cans of crescent rolls). I didn't add the olive and I also didn't used crushed croutons on the top, I didn't think it would need it.  Definitely a keeper!"
170064,557,8/6/2008,3,We love cream cheese appetizers but we found these to be a little bland.  I didn't include the olives which may have helped.  We thought they may be better if they were a little bit smaller.
917501,558,8/11/2008,5,"These are absolutely delicious! I omitted the olives (since we don't like them) and substituted green onions instead. I also threw in some frozen peas. These are terrific, and easy to make."
696386,558,8/26/2008,5,I admit I was a little scared of these but I made them for a party and everyone LOVED them. I followed the recipe exactly (which was very simple) and made them a couple hours before a party. They stayed tasty through the entire night. I ended up using the crutons inside the squares because it seemed easier and that worked too. yum!
968749,558,10/20/2008,4,I made these last night for dinner.  I actually made 2 batches - one as directed and the other with cheddar cheese instead of cream cheese for my DH who is not a fan of cream cheese.  I think I liked the one with cheddar better.  DH liked them and liked the fact that the bread was flakey and light.  I served with fried potatoes but I should have served with something else because the color palet was terrible...  golden brown with golden brown! Will probably make these again.
837995,558,10/24/2008,5,Great appetizer for a party!  We loved them and will make for my party that is coming up.  I am sure they will go over real well!
715957,558,12/31/2008,5,"These are my daughters' favorite!  I have to double the recipe, they eat so many of them.  I have sent leftovers for lunch, too.  Sometimes I substitute roasted red pepper for the olives.  Yum!"
371146,558,1/26/2007,5,These are the BEST mashed potatoes ever!!  I could eat the whole pot by myself!
204177,558,3/12/2009,5,"A great receipe, we substituted more onion instead of the olives and added about 1 ounce more cream cheese, it turned out great.  The wife and kid loved them."
622972,558,3/22/2009,4,"I used to make this back when we were newly weds, and lost the recipe.  This was very similar, but not exact.  I leave out the olives, and the croutons.  Good with a side salad."
874900,558,4/3/2009,4,Husband loved this.  I thought it was okay.  I made it in an 8x8 pan like another reviewer suggested since I am always short on time.  Left out olives and added sauteed mushrooms.  He wants me to make again but I will wait about a month or so.  It was an easy dish to prepare so I will make again.
1231301,558,4/8/2009,4,"You can save calories by using reduced fat crescent rolls and omitting the butter and croutons, add veggies by adding 1.5 cups each of steamed broccoli and cut corn, and save time if you use Onion and Chive flavored cream cheese instead of dicing onions. This is a great go-to meal if you're short on time, or patience, or ideas! YUM!"
517533,558,5/7/2009,5,"These were so good! I used the reduced fat crescent rolls, cut out the butter and croutons and added peas. I also topped with cheese in the last minutes of cooking and it was so delicious! i served it with stuffing and a gravy made in the same pan as the chicken, with a little flour, butter (roux if you will), chicken broth, and ff milk. SO GOOD!"
527375,558,8/8/2009,5,sooo good i used green onions
951589,558,9/19/2009,5,"I've made these twice now, and my husband is now requesting them weekly!  These are AMAZING!  I use the reduced fat cream cheese and reduced fat crescent rolls, and leave out the olives and chopped onion, and just throw in some onion powder. I stick a pot of water on the stove and heat to boiling, while I dice up chicken breasts.  I cook the chicken in the boiling water (covered) with chicken seasoning. It usually takes about 3-5 minutes.  By accident, I left out the milk the second time, and didn't notice a difference!  I also sprinkled the squares with grated parmesan cheese instead of the croutons...that was DELICIOUS!  Mine are usually done in about 18 minutes.  To reheat leftovers, I put them back in the oven at 250*...much better than becoming mushy in the microwave.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe that I will keep in my ""go-to"" recipes! :)"
876090,558,9/22/2009,5,"My Bride and I agree with all the positive reviews. Very easy and very satisfying. Next time I am going to use Tuna in place of the Chicken. Also, the Mushroom idea sounds good.
Thanks for the recipe.
C/J"
81522,558,10/9/2009,5,"I've made this recipe several times already but have never remembered to rate it.  It's fast, easy, and DELISH!!!  Pillsbury now makes crescent sheets, which makes this so much more easier to prepare.  It's become a favorite in my home!!! Thanks for sharing...."
714171,558,3/31/2010,5,"My mom used to make this when I was a kid, and making it for myself now did not disappoint! I used italian bread crumbs on the top. My kids loved it-- I think I might sneak some mixed veggies in there next time."
1191030,558,5/23/2010,5,"I really liked this. I didn't have any crescent rolls so I just made it like a casserole and it turned out really well! I did add some fresh minced garlic and included green olives. It was a little bit different but in a good way. I thought of serving it over pasta and I think that I'll do that next time if I'm once again out of crescent rolls. I also used garlic cheese croutons and loved them as the topping! At any rate, it's creamy, comforting, and very easy! Thank you so much! :)"
355637,558,11/28/2010,4,Yummm!!
1045865,558,12/19/2010,5,Delicious!   Easy and quick to make.
235355,558,2/7/2011,4,Very tasty and easy to make.  Mine may have been a bit more soft than they should have because I put them in covered containers soon after coming out of the oven so I could take them to the superbowl party.  Despite this they were a definite hit at the party.  Thanks for a great recipe!
717914,558,12/22/2011,4,Doubled recipe and left out the olives. All of us enjoyed this recipe for something differant.
1294683,558,7/7/2012,5,These were super good and easy!  I used green onions and substitued a handful of peas for the olives.  I used cheese and garlic croutons.  I doubled the recipe and the filling was exactly enough for 8 pockets (2 cans of crescents).  Good thing because my teenage son kept going back for more. Thanks for a delicious recipe that looks gourmet! My pic is the two pockets on a white plate next to a salad.   :)
2615281,558,1/5/2013,4,"VERY YUMMY! :-) me and my mom tripled the recipe and made outside out of little squares we made out of crescent dough sheets. We're taking them to a party, and i'm sure they'll be a hit!"
2604118,558,1/6/2013,4,Yummy! I used shredded BBQ chicken and panko bread crumbs in place of the croutons. Will make again.
1028382,559,7/9/2013,5,"My husband and I loved them! Sprinkled some Italian bread crumbs instead of the croutons, otherwise as directed.  My 6 year old complained but ate it, but that&#039;s normal about anything new.  Quick to throw together too!"
1800148278,560,10/23/2013,5,I tasted the meat mixture before folding them into the crescent envelopes. I used the &quot;triangle&quot; portions to feed a large number of my husbands firefighter co-workers. While I haven&#039;t yet tasted the entire ensemble... they look just stunning!!!! So I&#039;m going to go ahead and give it a five star rating. Because the meat mixture was scrummy-nummy-yummy. I loaded a picture of my minis. Are they beautiful! I hope the firemen are happy.
2001116026,560,8/5/2016,0,"This is a popular standard in our house. A few tweaks if they inspire anyone- I roast chicken tenders with a rotisserie chicken seasoning and pour the roasting juices into the mix. I also add sour cream instead of butter, 1/2 a packet of powdered ranch dip mix, grated onion (1 tbsp as recipe indicates), 1/2 cup finely grated parmesan and some fresh chopped parsley. I will also sub in the chopped green part of the scallion (2 tbsp) in place of the onion for some freshness if I have them on hand."
23333,561,5/13/2002,5,"This was extremely tasty!  I used honey ham and low fat swiss cheese. I also reduced the butter and added some fresh black pepper.  Served this with white and wild rice mixture (plain) and some baby carrots.  A delicious dinner that I will make again and again!

28995,561,6/8/2002,3,I must have had the heat too hight?  The sauce came out really thick and it seemed it could use more liquid.  This is the first time I tried the recipe and I had problems with the chicken too - when I pounded it out - it broke apart?  Any suggestions would be great!  But all in all it was that bad - just the cook and her preparation I guess lol!
6512,561,1/30/2003,5,I had some left over ham and needed a recipe to use it up and am so glad I found this one!!!! This was delicous!!!!! I added 1/2 cup of white wine to the sauce. I like lots of sauce and next time I will double the sauce. 
70845,561,2/5/2003,3,"Overall, this was a tasty recipe. The sauce did turn out really thick and most of the cheese melted out of the chicken while cooking, so I'll make some adjustments for next time. "
58229,561,10/1/2004,5,this was sooo good.  everyone raved about this recipe.  decided not to make the sauce and used another recipe for bernaise sauce instead and cooked the chicken in olive oil. it turned out fabulous.  my husband made a sandwhich for lunch the next day out of the leftovers.  thanks for the great recipe.  
291378,561,9/21/2006,4,"This was very good.  When I used to make it, I didn't know to flatten the breasts, and it really makes a difference.  I had to cook it much longer than suggested to get the centers done, and ended up cutting one in half to finish the center-but once I did that it took less than a minute to cook up.  The sauce was nice and thick and tasty."
186802,561,12/30/2006,5,"This was incredibly easy!  The only thing I didn't add was the parsley... I didn't have any on hand.  Other than that, I made it like stated, though I think mine looks more folded over than rolled.  It worked in any case.  Thanks for the delicious chicken cordon bleu recipe! :)"
663171,563,1/13/2009,4,this was good. i didn't care for the sauce and maybe it was just because my chicken breasts were on the lager side but i had to bake mine (just 350 cover w/foil for about 15 min w/a few splashes on chkn broth) after browning so i didn't burn it and made sure in was dine through. thanks for the recipe!
6512,564,5/31/2002,5,"I  knew this would be good since it was from Inez!!! The sauce was so supurb we could not stop licking our fingers and even the bowl!!!!!!! I only had 4 pounds of ribs so I only made 1/2 of the sauce. My grill has very uneven heat and not dependable, so I cooked the ribs in the oven on 350 with an inch of water for 1 1/2 hours and then basted and put on the grill. This will be a summer favorite!!!!!! Next time I may try this  on chicken."
35729,564,6/2/2002,5,"Thank you for a great tasting BBQ sauce, but I did change just one thing, I used just 1 tblsp. of the chili powder instead of 2, hubby can't take too much heat! He loved it, so this will be used quite a bit this summer not only on the spareribs, but chicken too!"
229236,565,7/8/2006,5,"I also used 1 tbsp. chili powder instead of 2.  This is an absolutely delicious sauce.  I used it on beef ribs and pork ribs, grilled over a slower heat for about 1.5 hours.  "
572998,565,5/18/2009,4,"The sauce for this recipe is pretty good, but the tomato taste was a bit strong and had me thinking pasta instead of ribs at times. I used baby back ribs cooked on the grill using low (~200degrees) indirect heat for a little over two hours."
424680,565,11/13/2008,5,"Although I followed the recipe pretty much, I did cut back the amount of red chile by about 2/3! I also used the more moist, chewy Medjool dates & came up with A GREAT TASTING CHUTNEY, & one I'll make again! Thanks for adding to my growing number of chutney recipes!

53002,565,3/31/2011,5,"I don't cook this type of food often, but I am a Texas girl and my family loves comfort food...and this recipe went over well at our dinner table tonight. I made it as directed and it turned out great! I will be making this again. Thank you for posting. Rachel Castle"
65197,565,10/5/2005,5,"I used one jalapeno chopped fine and sauted the tomatoes with the onion and pepper!!
YUMMY!!  DH thought I'd lost my mind...getting up to make breakfast before work..but soon realized it was worth my effort!!
Thanks!!"
169969,567,10/7/2005,5,This was a perfect breakfast! I used 2 roma tomatoes and left them as round thin slices (instead of chopping). Beautiful eggs! Thanks Bethie!
56112,567,6/23/2006,5,I am sitting here eating the most wonderful breakfast!!!  I used red onion and bell pepper because I didn't have any other kind.  Can't wait to give this a try with the Serrano.
223979,567,7/14/2006,5,This was a really great lunch today!  I used tomatoes and a pepper from my garden.  And I served it with refried beans .  Great recipe!
131126,567,7/16/2006,5,I subbed green pepper & a seeded jalapeno for the hotter peppers.  We really enjoyed our breakfast. Thanks elmotoo! 
175492,567,9/9/2006,5,"I made this for our breakfast this morning, but used Pablano Peppers instead of serrano (my serrano plant simply isn't producing heavy enough yet).  Wow, what a really tasty treat to start the day with!!!  Thank You Bethie for sharing a great breakfast with us."
269891,567,6/1/2007,5,Yum! I used jalapeno pepper(it was what I had on hand).
80353,567,6/20/2007,5,Nice and spicy breakfast eggs.  I used a hot banana pepper instead of the serrano (can't get them here) and scaled this down for just me.
58104,567,6/21/2007,5,"I made these again using jalapeno butter in place of the oil making a serving for one. thanks again.
 First reviewed Tuesday, October 04, 2005 Enjoyed these eggs with salsa recipe # 121276. I used cherry peppers from the garden. Cut the recipe for 1 and was still nice and filling. My tummy thanks you!"
